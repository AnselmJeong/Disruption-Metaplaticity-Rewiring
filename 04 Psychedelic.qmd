Psychedelic substances, such as psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), and dimethyltryptamine (DMT), are known to transiently dismantle canonical functional network architectures and facilitate global integration [@Tagliazucchi2018]. Carhart-Harris and colleagues [@CarhartHarris2014; @CarhartHarris2019] have conceptualized this phenomenon as an "entropic brain state." In this state of heightened entropy, the brain transitions into a more flexible regime, moving closer to "criticality"—a transitional zone between order and chaos. This stochasticity is considered therapeutic, as it enables the brain to escape from pathological metastable states or "stuck loops." Recent fMRI studies have confirmed a significant increase in functional connectivity (FC) following psychedelic administration [@Siegel2024]. This FC-mediated desegregation enables the system to access a "broader repertoire of potential brain states," effectively liberating it from the rigid dynamics associated with psychopathology.

A pivotal insight from psychedelic research is that these substances can reopen critical periods for neuroplastic learning [@Hensch2004; @Patton2019]. A critical period is a developmental window during which the nervous system is exceptionally sensitive to environmental stimuli, allowing for the acquisition of essential functions. Animal studies have demonstrated that the administration of various psychedelics to adult mice can re-engage critical periods—particularly in the context of social reward learning—that are typically restricted to early development [@Nardou2023]. Due to their ability to induce rapid and sustained structural and functional plasticity, psychedelics are often termed "psychoplastogens" [@Vargas2021]. At the cellular level, these agents promote synaptogenesis in the cortex and hippocampus within hours, either by stimulating BDNF production or by binding directly to the TrkB receptor independently of BDNF [@Moliner2023; @Shafiee2024].

Clinicians practicing psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy view the period following drug administration as a "window of opportunity" for therapeutic change, emphasizing that intensive psychotherapeutic interventions must be provided during this time [@CarhartHarris2018; @Lepow2021; @Lepow2023; @Caulfield2025]. This clinical expertise underscores that the critical period reopened by psychedelics serves as the prime period for therapeutic intervention.

These characteristics of psychedelics align closely with the attractor landscape described in dynamical systems models and the DMR framework proposed herein for the mechanism of action of ECT. Following ECT, a period of heightened neuroplasticity ensues—characterized by rapid increases in BDNF and transient network disruption—that is similarly constrained to a specific temporal window. Much like psychedelics, ECT demonstrates transdiagnostic efficacy across various psychiatric conditions; however, its application in isolation often yields transient benefits, with frequent relapse occurring in the absence of subsequent therapeutic intervention. Given these parallels, the necessity of intensive post-ECT therapeutic engagement must be underscored.

The reopened critical state is not inherently curative; rather, it represents a window of heightened malleability during which the system can be steered toward recovery or further dysfunction. The direction of this evolution is contingent upon therapeutic intervention and environmental context. Similarly, ECT can be conceptualized as a catalyst that destabilizes pathological attractors without inherently guaranteeing clinical remission. Without deliberate, structured intervention to guide the brain's trajectory, the system may revert to its previous state or settle into a new maladaptive pattern.

This perspective necessitates a re-evaluation of post-ECT therapeutic interventions. Traditionally, drug or psychotherapy following ECT was endowed with a passive role in preventing relapse. However, if ECT induces a "metaplastic window" analogous to psychedelics, then the role of subsequent treatment becomes highly important. Furthermore, it can be predicted that, as with psychedelics, the metaplastic window remains open for a limited duration, during which therapeutic efficacy is maximal. While this period of increased plasticity is reported to last for days to weeks in the case of psychedelics, the precise duration of the metaplastic window following ECT requires further empirical validation.
