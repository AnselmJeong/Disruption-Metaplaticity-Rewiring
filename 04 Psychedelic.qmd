Psychedelic substances, such as psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), and dimethyltryptamine (DMT), are known to transiently dismantle canonical functional network architectures and facilitate global integration [@Tagliazucchi2018]. Carhart-Harris et al. [@CarhartHarris2014; @CarhartHarris2019] have conceptualized this phenomenon as an "entropic brain state." In this state, the brain transitions into a more flexible regime, moving closer to "criticality"—a transitional zone between order and chaos. This stochasticity is considered therapeutic, as it enables the brain to escape from pathological states or "stuck loops." Recent fMRI studies have confirmed a significant desynchronization in functional connectivity (FC) following psilocybin administration [@Siegel2024]. This FC-mediated desegregation enables the system to access a "broader repertoire of potential brain states," effectively liberating it from the rigid dynamics associated with psychopathology.

A pivotal insight from psychedelic research is that these substances can reopen critical periods for neuroplastic learning [@Hensch2004; @Patton2019]. A critical period is an early developmental window during which the nervous system is exceptionally sensitive to environmental stimuli, allowing for the acquisition of essential knowledge for survival. Animal studies have demonstrated that the administration of psychedelics to adult mice can re-engage critical periods that are typically restricted to early development, particularly in the context of social reward learning [@Nardou2023]. Due to their ability to induce rapid and sustained structural and functional plasticity, psychedelics are often termed "psychoplastogens" [@Vargas2021]. At the cellular level, these agents promote synaptogenesis in the cortex and hippocampus within hours, either by stimulating BDNF production or by binding directly to the TrkB receptor [@Moliner2023; @Shafiee2024].

Clinicians practicing psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy view the period following drug administration as a "window of opportunity" for therapeutic change, emphasizing that intensive psychotherapeutic interventions must be provided during this time [@CarhartHarris2018; @Lepow2021; @Lepow2023; @Caulfield2025]. This clinical expertise underscores that the critical period reopened by psychedelics serves as the prime period for therapeutic intervention.

These features of psychedelics map naturally onto an attractor-based account of psychopathology in dynamical systems terms and resonate with the DMR framework developed in this paper. Acute $5\text{-HT}_{2\text{A}}$-mediated perturbation transiently reduces within- and between-network integrity, leading to a temporary “flattening” of the attractor landscape and enhanced transitions among metastable states [@Roseman2014;@Madsen2021;@Singleton2022]. Following this disruption, a time-limited metaplastic window opens in which activity-dependent synaptic remodeling is facilitated via BDNF–TrkB-linked pathways. Clinically, psychedelic-assisted interventions show transdiagnostic efficacy across diverse conditions, yet these benefits appear to be time-limited; without structured psychotherapy and positive environmental stimuli, symptom gains may attenuate as the system relaxes back toward pre-existing maladaptive attractors [@CarhartHarris2018a;@Goodwin2022].
