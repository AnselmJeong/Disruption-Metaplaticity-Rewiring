The neurobiological pathways translating ECT-induced seizures into clinical efficacy and/or cognitive side effects remain largely elusive. One promising approach to elucidating these mechanisms is to analyze the reconfigurations in brain functional connectivity following ECT. ECT is frequently conceptualized through the computational metaphor of a "system reboot." A standard reboot sequence initiates by transmitting termination signals to all active processes and resetting CPU registers to default states. Only subsequently does the operating system kernel reload, re-initializing hardware interfaces and sequentially restarting system services to achieve a "clean state," purged of prior errors. While the biological complexity of the brain defies direct comparison, this metaphor offers a powerful frame of reference. The seizure effectively broadcasts a termination signal to aberrant neural activity, dismantling pathological hyperconnectivity between network modules. This acute disruption precipitates profound shifts in metaplasticity, facilitating the pruning of maladaptive synaptic connections and the rewiring of functional networks—mirroring the re-initialization of system drivers. This metaphoric framework has implicitly influenced theoretical models of ECT and is increasingly substantiated by empirical evidence of post-ECT network dynamics.

Extending this analogy, if the seizure represents the physical act of pressing the reset switch, it may constitute a necessary but insufficient condition for therapeutic success. It is likely that the critical determinant is not the triggering event itself, but the integrity of the subsequent "cleaning" and "reconfiguration" phases. Modern clinical paradigms have thus pivoted from maximizing seizure duration to optimizing "seizure adequacy"—characterized by sufficient postictal suppression [@AZUMA2007; @FrancisTaylor2020]. This shift acknowledges that the therapeutic process occurs largely after the ictus has ceased. This paradigm shift has unfolded gradually over time. Ironically, it had been postulated that ECT worked because it induced retrograde amnesia, essentially "erasing" traumatic memory traces that maintain depressive mood [@Cameron1960; @Miller1967]. This was subsequently followed by the theory that ECT exerts its therapeutic action via an anticonvulsant mechanism [@Duthie2015]. Traditionally, the generalized seizure was considered the sine qua non of ECT efficacy. However, the ascendancy of the neuroplasticity hypothesis [@Duman2006; @Laroy2025] has challenged this dogma [@Lisanby2007; @Deng2024].

Activating this reset switch, however, inevitably entails collateral consequences. The disruptive impact of ECT is often more readily observed through immediate cognitive deficits. Gbyl et al.[@Gbyl2024] reported significant reductions in functional coupling between the hippocampus and posterior default mode network (DMN) hubs, specifically the precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex, suggesting a breakdown in the temporal synchrony required for memory. Historically, transient cognitive impairment was deemed an inevitable tradeoff for ECT efficacy. However, as the focus has shifted away from seizure intensity per se, there is a growing expectation that meticulous optimization of stimulation parameters can secure therapeutic adequacy without precipitating memory deficits [@Weiner1984; @Sackeim2007].

In this framework, it is essential to examine the sequential physiological cascade following the ictus. Upon seizure termination, the first observable phase is **Postictal Suppression**. This represents an acute phase of network inhibition and bioelectric silence immediately following seizure termination. This state is assumed to be driven by a massive release of GABA and an adenosine surge that blocks presynaptic glutamate release. This period of depolarization block serves as the physiological marker of efficacy in disrupting pathological rigid priors, effectively dismantling the system's maladaptive attractor state.

This phase is followed by Postictal Slowing which is characterized by a pronounced increase in the power of delta and theta rhythms [@fink1957; @kolbeinsson1988; @rosn1987]. During this period, thalamocortical re-coupling is delayed, and synaptic downscaling occurs to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio, thereby opening a "window of plasticity" [@leaver2022]. It is within this temporal window that metabolic recovery aligns with the induction of neurotrophic factors like BDNF, facilitating the recalibration of neural networks and the restoration of excitatory-inhibitory balance essential for therapeutic rewiring.

Recent optical neuroimaging evidence leads us to reinterpret these phenomena through the lens of **Cortical Spreading Depolarization (CSD)** [@Rosenthal2025]. As prevously noted, authors of this study suggest that the seizure is merely the trigger for a secondary, wavefront-propagating event. CSD is a wave of massive neuronal depolarization that travels slowly across the cortex, silencing bioelectric activity in its wake. This event represents a profound physiological reset characterized by the breakdown of transmembrane ion gradients and a surge in extracellular glutamate and adenosine. This also triggers a multiphasic hemodynamic signature: an initial **massive hyperemic surge** (\>200% flow increase) driven by the metabolic crisis of depolarization, followed by a transient **oligemic vasoconstriction** (flow reduction), and finally a prolonged **rebound hyperemia** supporting metabolic recovery. Crucially, it is this coordinated alteration of neuronal activity that may drive the upregulation of immediate early genes (*c-Fos*, *Arc*) and plasticity-related proteins (*Homer1*), effectively converting the acute disruption into a long-term neurotrophic signal [@KaastrupMller2015; @Dyrvig2015; @DellOrco2023].

The metabolic sequelae of ECT can be indexed by changes in N-acetylaspartate (NAA), the most abundant amino acid–derived metabolite in the brain and a widely accepted marker of neuronal viability and mitochondrial integrity [@Moffett2007]. Consistent with this, transient reductions in NAA within the anterior cingulate cortex have been observed 7–14 days following a course of ECT, with subsequent normalization at 6-month follow-up [@erchinger2023]. This reversible decline likely reflects a temporary perturbation of neuronal metabolic function rather than irreversible structural damage, and may thus serve as a biochemical correlate of the acute "disruption" phase posited by the DPR framework.
