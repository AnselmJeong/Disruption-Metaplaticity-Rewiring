Neuromodulatory and pharmacological interventions are thought to facilitate therapeutic recovery by remodeling neural networks through neuroplasticity. These networks can be conceptualized as comprising static or dynamic functional connectivity (FC) and structural connectivity (SC). Changes in these connectivity profiles induced by treatment occur across disparate timescales. Recent research has begun to characterize the complex coupling between functional and structural connectivity and their respective contributions to the therapeutic process.

It was found that rapid-acting interventions, such as ketamine and ECT, precipitate an immediate, state-dependent reconfiguration of functional connectivity (FC) within minutes to hours. This acute functional shift, characterized by fluctuations in neuromodulatory tone and synaptic gain, is hypothesized to permit the neural system to escape maladaptive attractor states prior to any anatomical remodeling (10.64898/2025.12.29.696846). Contemporary models of macroscale brain organization suggest that these dynamic changes in FC serve as the primary driver of network reconfiguration, acting as a blueprint for exploration that is subsequently stabilized by slower structural mechanisms (10.1038/s41583-024-00846-6).

However, the neurobiological reality is more nuanced; rather than a unidirectional progression from functional to structural reconfiguration, a reciprocal influence exists where SC provides the scaffolding that constrains the state space available for functional exploration. Beyond this bidirectional interdependence, the FC-SC coupling is itself exhibits dynamic fluctuations in strength. The degree of coupling not only underpins the manifestation of disease states but also presents a critical window for therapeutic intervention and network restoration.

## Neuroplasticity Frameworks in Depression: From Monoamines to Network Dynamics

The current neuroplasticity paradigm of major mental illness emphasizes the restoration of synaptic plasticity and the reversal of stress-induced neuronal atrophy, particularly within corticolimbic circuits, as critical mechanisms for therapeutic action (10.25886/3J3W-ZX18). Historically, the therapeutic effects of conventional antidepressants were thought to be mediated by delayed-onset structural neuroplastic changes. However, the rapid and sustained antidepressant effects of ECT and ketamine have prompted a reconsideration of this traditional view.

Dynamic causal modeling of resting-state functional MRI data after ECT has identified specific neural pathway modulations that underpin these rapid antidepressant effects, reinforcing the concept that correcting large-scale network dysfunction is a primary mechanism for treatment gain. This network remodeling operates across molecular, cellular, and macroscale levels, manifesting in both functional and structural domains. A critical question remains regarding the temporal hierarchy of these changes: do molecular shifts primarily drive immediate functional reconfigurations that eventually consolidate into structural modifications? Furthermore, does cellular-level reorganization—such as the formation of new synapses—represent the formal initiation of structural connectivity (SC) changes, and does the eventual stabilization of SC ultimately constrain the capacity for further dynamic functional exploration?


## Acute Functional Reconfiguration: Synaptic Gain and Network-Level Modulation

The immediate reconfiguration of functional connectivity (FC) observed in the minutes to hours following neuromodulatory interventions is characterized by a rapid, state-dependent shift in network dynamics that precedes stable structural remodeling. These acute alterations are primarily driven by fluctuations in neuromodulatory tone, which modulate synaptic gain and reconfigure the landscape of the neural state space. At this stage, FC changes—measured as temporal synchronization between brain regions—can occur independently of structural changes, guided by shifts in excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance, arousal levels, and signal precision. For instance, ketamine induces an immediate glutamate surge through NMDA receptor antagonism and the disinhibition of GABAergic interneurons, leading to increased cortical excitability and rapid FC reconfiguration even before the onset of synaptogenesis (10.1016/j.pnpbp.2015.06.001). Furthermore, changes in arousal modulate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and gamma-band power, further contributing to these immediate functional shifts (10.1016/j.pbb.2020.172856). While these functional changes serve as a template for subsequent structural modifications, the actual manifestation of SC changes—such as increased dendritic spine density and synaptic formation—typically unfolds over hours to days, initiated by the activation of molecular pathways like BDNF and mTOR.

This rapid reconfiguration of FC patterns triggers activity-dependent plasticity—consistent with the Hebbian principle that "neurons that fire together, wire together"—wherein synaptic connections are strengthened to stabilize the newly established activity patterns. In the case of ketamine, although clinical symptom relief can occur within hours, the stabilization of structural changes requires several days (10.1523/ENEURO.0133-15.2016). Specifically, Wu et al. (10.1016/j.biopsych.2020.12.022) demonstrated that the potential for evoked spinogenesis peaks within 2 hours post-administration before returning to baseline, while a measurable increase in dendritic spine density only emerges after 12 hours. This temporal lag suggests that FC changes precede and provide the necessary signal for structural remodeling in primed neurons. Consequently, while acute FC shifts likely underpin immediate therapeutic responses, subsequent structural neuroplasticity serves to consolidate and sustain these improvements (10.1126/science.aat8078), a process also reflected in the delayed hippocampal volume increases observed approximately one week after ECT (10.1097/YCT.0b013e3181a95da8; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2018.05.017).


## Structural Consolidation and Morphological Adaptation: Time-Course of Remodeling


The consolidation of transient neuronal activity into enduring anatomical architecture represents a critical, delayed phase of neuroplasticity, typically extending from days to weeks following initial stimuli. This structural remodeling (SR) serves as the physical substrate for long-term behavioral adaptation and is characterized by spinogenesis, dendritic arborization, and synaptogenesis, primarily within the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus. However, rapid-acting antidepressants such as ketamine and ECT trigger near-instantaneous shifts in intracellular signaling pathways associated with neuroplasticity. Consequently, the transition from functional connectivity (FC) reconfigurations to structural connectivity (SC) modifications begins within a significantly compressed timeframe.

For instance, while estradiol infusion into the dorsal hippocampus rapidly activates ERK and mTOR within minutes, the resultant increase in spine density on CA1 pyramidal neurons is observed at 30 minutes and persists for at least 2 hours (10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3135-15.2016). This cross-regional coupling suggests that immediate effects in one region can drive delayed structural remodeling in another. High-frequency rTMS applied over the mPFC for five days is sufficient to increase dendritic spine density in both layer II/III and layer V pyramidal neurons (10.3389/fncel.2022.1082211). These morphological changes correlate with behavioral signs of antidepressant effects, indicating that the structural consolidation of rTMS-induced therapeutic effects may occur within a week (10.3389/fncel.2022.1082211).

Synaptic-level changes emerging within days of therapeutic intervention must be stabilized over the long term, maturing into robust signaling pathways. This persistence and maturation are tightly regulated by the delicate balance between plasticity and stability. Vascular endothelial growth factor D (VEGFD) is essential for maintaining mature dendritic trees by influencing the actin cortex and reducing microtubule dynamics; interestingly, VEGFD is downregulated during synaptic activity-induced structural plasticity, suggesting that the suppression of stabilization factors is necessary to permit remodeling (10.1007/s00018-024-05357-2).

## Temporal Asymmetry and Causal Interplay Between Functional and Structural Plasticity

As discussed, rapid and adaptive changes in functional connectivity (FC) generally serve as the primary driver of network reconfiguration, which is subsequently stabilized—or consolidated—by slower structural remodeling (10.1038/s41583-024-00846-6). If depression is conceptualized as a state where neural circuits are locked into a maladaptive configuration, the FC changes following therapeutic intervention can be viewed as a process of overcoming structural constraints to explore alternative pathways. When these interventions identify healthier connectivity patterns, they provide a functional scaffold for subsequent structural reorganization (10.1007/978-3-031-72069-7_35). The eventual consolidation of these functional patterns into stable structural architectures is thought to establish new attractor states, encoding long-term behavioral or cognitive adaptations. Conversely, a failure in this consolidation mechanism may underpin the vulnerability to relapse or the persistence of maladaptive network states.

This dynamic interplay mirrors developmental processes, particularly during critical periods which act as metaplastic windows. In the immediate postnatal period, the brain exhibits significant decoupling, where functional patterns diverge from the underlying structural blueprint, especially in early-maturing sensory areas (10.1073/pnas.2412729122). This suggests that early in life, FC reconfigures rapidly in response to environmental stimuli before the maturation of dense structural connections. As development progresses through childhood and adolescence, a distinct trend toward increased SC-FC coupling emerges within the frontoparietal and default mode networks (10.1101/2023.09.11.557107). This age-dependent strengthening of coupling supports the hypothesis that successful functional patterns are gradually "fixed" by structural consolidation, trading system plasticity for stability and efficiency.

Alterations in the strength of FC-SC coupling itself can serve as both a driver and a biomarker of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative conditions. For instance, in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), abnormally strong SC-FC coupling is observed, which correlates with impaired cognitive flexibility and altered neural oscillations (10.1063/5.0294575). Similarly, in Parkinson’s disease, a lower E/I ratio is associated with more rigid SC-FC coupling along the cytoarchitectonic hierarchy, suggesting that neurochemical dysregulation can drive the pathological stabilization of network dynamics (10.1038/s41531-025-01028-6). Conversely, the weakening of SC-FC coupling is a hallmark of neurodegeneration. In Alzheimer’s disease and mild cognitive impairment, amyloid pathology is linked to aberrant SC-FC coupling, manifesting as a breakdown in the correspondence between anatomical wiring and functional co-activation (10.1007/s00259-025-07172-8; 10.1162/netn_a_00461). This decoupling likely represents the erosion of the structural anchors required to maintain stable functional attractor states. These findings underscore that structural plasticity does not occur in isolation but acts as a delayed, stabilizing response to functional dynamics; when this coordinated coupling is perturbed, the brain's capacity to transition between or maintain adaptive attractor states is profoundly compromised.


------------------

Neuromodulatory and pharmacological interventions are thought to facilitate therapeutic recovery by remodeling neural networks through neuroplasticity. These networks can be characterized in terms of functional connectivity (FC)—the temporal co-activation of spatially distributed brain regions—and structural connectivity (SC)—the anatomical wiring that physically links them. Treatment-induced changes in these two domains unfold across different timescales, yet they do not proceed in parallel isolation. Rather, recent evidence reveals a complex, reciprocal coupling between functional and structural connectivity whose dynamic modulation constitutes a critical axis of the therapeutic process. Examining this relationship will help clarify that the progression of disruption - metaplasticity - rewiring following therapeutic intervention is not a sequence of discrete stages, but rather a set of deeply intertwined processes.

## Neuroplasticity Frameworks in Depression: From Monoamines to Network Dynamics

The prevailing neuroplasticity paradigm of major mental illness posits that therapeutic action depends upon the restoration of synaptic plasticity and the reversal of stress-induced neuronal atrophy, particularly within corticolimbic circuits (10.25886/3J3W-ZX18). Historically, the efficacy of conventional antidepressants was attributed to delayed-onset structural changes—a view congruent with their protracted therapeutic latency. However, the rapid and sustained antidepressant effects of ECT and ketamine have compelled a fundamental reconsideration of this view.

Detailed analysis of resting-state fMRI data following ECT and ketamine has identified several alterations in the interconnection among large-scale neural networks that may underpin the rapid antidepressant effects. This network remodeling operates simultaneously across molecular, cellular, and macroscale levels, manifesting in both functional and structural domains. A critical unresolved question concerns the temporal hierarchy governing these changes: whether molecular shifts primarily drive immediate functional reconfigurations that eventually consolidate into structural modifications, or whether the existing SC constrains the capacity for functional exploration, that is the potential space of FC changes.

## Acute Functional Reconfiguration: Synaptic Gain and Network-Level Modulation

Rapid-acting interventions such as ECT and ketamine precipitate an immediate, state-dependent reconfiguration of FC within minutes to hours—a shift that precedes any stable structural remodeling. This acute functional reorganization is driven primarily by fluctuations in neuromodulatory tone that adjust synaptic gain and remodel the landscape of the neural state space. At this timescale, FC changes can occur independently of structural remodeling, guided by shifts in excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance, arousal levels, and signal precision (10.64898/2025.12.29.696846). Contemporary models of macroscale brain organization suggest that these functional changes serve as the primary driver of network reconfiguration, acting as a scaffold for exploration that is subsequently stabilized by slower structural mechanisms (10.1038/s41583-024-00846-6).

The pharmacology of ketamine illustrates this temporal logic with particular clarity. NMDA receptor antagonism and the consequent disinhibition of GABAergic interneurons produce an immediate glutamate surge, which elevates cortical excitability and triggers rapid FC reconfiguration well before the onset of synaptogenesis (10.1016/j.pnpbp.2015.06.001). Concurrently, changes in arousal modulate the signal-to-noise ratio and gamma-band power, further shaping these immediate functional shifts (10.1016/j.pbb.2020.172856).

Crucially, this acute FC reconfiguration is not merely epiphenomenal but initiates activity-dependent plasticity—consistent with the Hebbian principle that "neurons that fire together, wire together"—through which synaptic connections are strengthened to stabilize newly established activity patterns. However, a temporal dissociation exists between the functional template and its structural instantiation. Wu et al. (10.1016/j.biopsych.2020.12.022) demonstrated that following ketamine administration, the potential for evoked spinogenesis peaks within 2 hours before returning to baseline, whereas a measurable increase in dendritic spine density emerges only after 12 hours. This lag implies that FC changes precede and provide the necessary instructive signal for structural remodeling in primed neurons (10.1523/ENEURO.0133-15.2016). Consequently, while acute FC shifts likely underpin immediate therapeutic responses, subsequent structural neuroplasticity serves to consolidate and sustain these improvements (10.1126/science.aat8078)—a process also reflected in the delayed hippocampal volume increases observed approximately one week after ECT (10.1097/YCT.0b013e3181a95da8; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2018.05.017).

## Structural Consolidation and Morphological Adaptation: Time-Course of Remodeling

The consolidation of transient neuronal activity into enduring anatomical architecture represents a critical, delayed phase of neuroplasticity, typically extending from days to weeks following initial stimuli. This structural remodeling serves as the physical substrate for long-term behavioral adaptation and is characterized by spinogenesis, dendritic arborization, and synaptogenesis—predominantly within the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Notably, rapid-acting antidepressants such as ketamine and ECT trigger near-instantaneous shifts in intracellular signaling cascades associated with neuroplasticity, thereby compressing the transition from FC reconfiguration to the initiation of SC modifications into a significantly shorter timeframe than conventionally assumed.

The cross-regional dynamics of this process merit particular attention. While estradiol infusion into the dorsal hippocampus rapidly activates ERK and mTOR within minutes, the resultant increase in spine density on CA1 pyramidal neurons is observed at 30 minutes and persists for at least 2 hours (10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3135-15.2016)—a pattern suggesting that immediate molecular effects in one region can drive delayed structural remodeling in synaptically connected areas. In the case of rTMS, high-frequency stimulation applied over the medial PFC for five days is sufficient to increase dendritic spine density in both layer II/III and layer V pyramidal neurons, with these morphological changes correlating with behavioral signs of antidepressant effects and suggesting that the structural consolidation of rTMS-induced therapeutic gains may occur within a week (10.3389/fncel.2022.1082211).

Yet synaptic-level changes emerging within days of therapeutic intervention must themselves be stabilized over the long term, maturing into robust signaling pathways. This persistence is tightly regulated by the delicate balance between plasticity and stability. Vascular endothelial growth factor D (VEGFD), for instance, is essential for maintaining mature dendritic trees by influencing the actin cortex and reducing microtubule dynamics; notably, VEGFD is downregulated during synaptic activity-induced structural plasticity, suggesting that the active suppression of stabilization factors is a prerequisite for permitting remodeling (10.1007/s00018-024-05357-2).

## Temporal Asymmetry and Causal Interplay Between Functional and Structural Plasticity

The foregoing evidence establishes a general temporal asymmetry: rapid, adaptive changes in FC serve as the primary driver of network reconfiguration, which is subsequently stabilized—or consolidated—by slower structural remodeling (10.1038/s41583-024-00846-6). If depression is conceptualized as a state in which neural circuits are locked into a maladaptive attractor configuration, then the FC changes following therapeutic intervention can be understood as a process of overcoming structural constraints to explore alternative network trajectories. When these perturbations identify healthier connectivity patterns, they provide a functional scaffold upon which subsequent structural reorganization can proceed (10.1007/978-3-031-72069-7_35). The eventual consolidation of these functional patterns into stable structural architectures is thought to establish new attractor states encoding long-term behavioral and cognitive adaptations; conversely, failure in this consolidation mechanism may underpin vulnerability to relapse or the persistence of maladaptive network configurations.

However, the neurobiological reality transcends this unidirectional narrative. SC does not merely await functional instruction—it actively constrains the state space available for functional exploration, rendering the relationship fundamentally bidirectional. Moreover, the FC-SC coupling itself exhibits dynamic fluctuations in strength, and it is the modulation of this coupling—rather than changes in either domain alone—that may constitute the most critical therapeutic variable.

This dynamic interplay recapitulates principles observed in neurodevelopment, particularly during critical periods that function as metaplastic windows. In the immediate postnatal period, the brain exhibits significant FC-SC decoupling, where functional patterns diverge from the underlying structural blueprint—especially in early-maturing sensory areas (10.1073/pnas.2412729122). This decoupling suggests that early in life, FC reconfigures rapidly in response to environmental stimuli before the maturation of dense structural connections. As development progresses through childhood and adolescence, a distinct trend toward increased SC-FC coupling emerges within the frontoparietal and default mode networks (10.1101/2023.09.11.557107). This age-dependent strengthening of coupling supports the hypothesis that successful functional patterns are gradually "fixed" by structural consolidation, trading system plasticity for stability and efficiency.

Alterations in the strength of FC-SC coupling itself can serve as both a driver and a biomarker of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative conditions. In Autism Spectrum Disorder, abnormally strong SC-FC coupling correlates with impaired cognitive flexibility and altered neural oscillations (10.1063/5.0294575). In Parkinson's disease, a lower E/I ratio is associated with more rigid SC-FC coupling along the cytoarchitectonic hierarchy, suggesting that neurochemical dysregulation can drive the pathological stabilization of network dynamics (10.1038/s41531-025-01028-6). Conversely, the weakening of SC-FC coupling is a hallmark of neurodegeneration: in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment, amyloid pathology is linked to aberrant SC-FC coupling, manifesting as a breakdown in the correspondence between anatomical wiring and functional co-activation (10.1007/s00259-025-07172-8; 10.1162/netn_a_00461). This decoupling likely represents the erosion of the structural anchors required to maintain stable functional attractor states. Taken together, these findings underscore that structural plasticity does not operate in isolation but acts as a delayed, stabilizing response to functional dynamics; when this coordinated coupling is perturbed—whether through excessive rigidity or pathological erosion—the brain's capacity to transition between or maintain adaptive attractor states is profoundly compromised.
