Among the therapeutic modalities that modulate neural plasticity, rTMS occupies a unique niche. It functions primarily through targeted synaptic "rewiring" unlike other modalities that induce non-specific shifts in metaplasticity (10.1073/pnas.95.26.15635). rTMS focuses on modulating individual synapses within specific neural circuits through the induction of Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) and/or Long-Term Depression (LTD) (10.1186/1743-0003-6-7; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2023.11.016; ).

The mechanism relies on electromagnetic induction, where focal magnetic fields generate intracranial electric currents that depolarize neurons and stimulate glutamate release at the targeted cortical ares. The activation of NMDA and AMPA receptors by induced depolarization determines the direction of plasticity: high-frequency stimulation triggers a massive influx of calcium (Ca^{2+}), activating pathways like CaMKII to increase AMPA receptor density (LTP), while low-frequency stimulation leads to a lower, sustained calcium influx that promotes AMPA receptor internalization (LTD) (10.1016/j.neuron.2016.12.015;10.1016/j.neuron.2012.11.016).

In general, the localized depolarization does not produce the global disruption characteristic of ECT or psychedelics. Neither does it produce postictal suppression or cortical slowing seen after seizures, and cognitive side effects are exceptionally rare and transient (10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2016.3644). While it shares a common mechanism involving neuroplasticity with other therapies, rTMS is distinguished by its ability to precisely control both the direction and the spatial distribution of neuroplasticity (10.1016/j.neuron.2007.06.026).

## LTP and LTD

Among the various therapeutic modalities aiming to manipulate neural plasticity—including ECT, psychedelics, rTMS, and pharmacotherapy—rTMS is unique in its explicit use of Long-Term Depression (LTD) as a therapeutic mechanism. However, the degree to which LTD truly underpins therapeutic efficacy is still debated; in humans, its existence is mainly inferred through the suppression of motor evoked potentials (MEP) following inhibitory rTMS protocols. 

In conventional rTMS, the direction (LTP or LTD) is primarily controlled by the stimulation frequency: high-frequency (>5 Hz) rTMS generally increases cortical excitability and promotes LTP-like potentiation, whereas low-frequency (≤1 Hz) rTMS tends to decrease excitability and induce LTD-like effects (10.1016/s0006-3223(00)01065-9). In contrast, newer protocols such as theta burst stimulation (TBS) modulate the balance through the pattern of delivery. Specifically, intermittent delivery (iTBS) lead to LTP-like effects, whereas continuous delivery (cTBS) lead to LTD-like effects [@biomedicines12112506].

Historically, the pathophysiology of depression was frequently conceptualized as left-hemispheric hypoactivity within the DLPFC and compensatory right-hemispheric hyperactivity. Consequently, it was posited that suppressing the latter via 1Hz (inhibitory) rTMS would restore homeostatic balance. While this "inhibitory strategy" continues to be widely employed in clinical settings, definitive evidence that its therapeutic efficacy stems directly from the induction of synaptic LTD remains elusive.

Regardless of its precise molecular underpinnings, the capacity of rTMS to induce directional change distinguishes it from more globally disruptive interventions. Whereas ECT and psychedelics are characterized by massive, system-wide disruptions, rTMS operates through discrete, topographic modifications. While ECT and psychedelics may also induce LTD-like changes through synaptic downscaling and homeostatic rebalancing, these effects occur non-selectively across broad cortical and subcortical circuitries, lacking the regional specificity inherent to rTMS.

In the metaphorical language of dynamical systems theory, ECT and psychedelics seem to demolish and soften the state-space landscape, thereby enhancing global malleability. In contrast, rTMS seems to carefully sculpt the neuronal circuits to allow targeted dissolution of deep attractor basins and restoring the resilence of healthy basins. This remodeling process will help to restore the normal, adaptive connectivity patterns.

Pharmacological interventions, such as SSRIs, represent a third distinct category. SSRIs typically lack the regional specificity of rTMS and appear to rely more heavily on maintaining  "metaplastic window" to promote LTP like plasticity. By modulating neurotrophic signaling and receptor sensitivity over extended periods, SSRIs create a permissive environment for gradual reorganization. Rather than actively sculpting the landscape, SSRIs provide the milieu in which environmental stimuli or life experiences can slowly reshape the neural topography.

Taken together, these observations highlight the "fine-grained sculpting" capability of rTMS. While ECT and psychedelics function as global disruptors that increase system-wide plasticity, and SSRIs act as environmental facilitators, rTMS uniquely allows for the exquisite carving of the neural landscape.


## Homeostatic and Spatially Specific Plasticity Mechanisms in rTMS

rTMS engages multiple forms of neuroplasticity, including both Hebbian synapse-specific changes and homeostatic regulatory processes. While classical models emphasize LTP and LTD as the primary mechanisms, a growing literature indicates that rTMS also engages homeostatic plasticity, a set of compensatory processes that stabilize neuronal activity in response to prolonged perturbations (10.1016/j.brs.2015.01.404;10.1111/j.1460-9568.2007.05603.x;10.1016/j.neuint.2025.106021;10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011027).

Homeostatic plasticity operates to preserve network stability by adjusting synaptic properties when average activity deviates from a set point(10.1016/s0166-2236(98)01341-1;10.1016/j.conb.2011.09.006;10.1016/j.brs.2015.01.404). Basicall, rTMS is a global homeostatic plasticity that maintains network stability by adjusting synaptic properties when average activity deviates from a set point. Widespread shifts in average firing rates trigger uniform scaling of synaptic strength across brain regions: prolonged increases in network activity produce synaptic downscaling, whereas sustained low activity leads to upscaling of synaptic weights (10.1101/cshperspect.a005736). This global scaling preserves the relative differences among synaptic weights while normalizing overall excitability, thereby preventing pathological hyper- or hypo-excitability.

Concurrently, a local homeostatic adjustment is also in effect. According to the sliding threshold model such as BCM, homeostatic mechanisms are driven by local activity history (10.1016/j.brs.2015.01.404). Circuit elements that experience relatively higher activity over rTMS sessions may undergo proportionally stronger compensatory downscaling compared to less active elements, that is, prior activity biases the balance between potentiation and depression. In principle, it is possible that the same stimulation paradigm produces opposite plastic effects depending on baseline excitability or recent stimulation history (10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5316-03.2004;10.1016/j.biopsych.2023.09.011).

These homeostatic processes interact with the regional specificity of rTMS. Homeostatic adjustment confined to a specific region occurs against a backdrop of global adjustment. This homeostatic principle explains why rTMS effects are state dependent and not strictly monotonic with stimulation frequency or intensity: both the baseline excitability of targeted circuits and the pattern of network activity can bias subsequent plasticity. In this way, rTMS may modulate cortical excitatory–inhibitory balance through the combined action of directionally specific synaptic plasticity (LTP/LTD-like effects) and homeostatic regulation of network excitability, thereby facilitating circuit-level recalibration without global disruption (10.1016/j.conb.2022.102553).

## Structural Plasticity: The Remodeling of Dendritic Spines

The functional changes induced by rTMS are physically manifested through structural plasticity, specifically the remodeling of dendritic spines. These tiny protrusions are the primary sites of excitatory synaptic input, and their morphology reflects their functional state. 

Dendritic spine이 

- **Filopodia**: Long, thin, immature protrusions that lack a distinct head. They serve as "feelers," exploring the environment and representing a highly plastic state.
- **Thin Spines**: Characterized by a small head and long neck, these are often considered "learning spines," capable of significant enlargement or retraction.
- **Mushroom Spines**: Possessing large heads and narrow necks, these are "memory spines"—stable, strong, and containing a high density of AMPA and NMDA receptors.
- **Stubby Spines**: Intermediate structures lacking a distinct neck, often seen during transitions in spine development.

rTMS induces "plasticity" by driving spinogenesis (the formation of new spines) and the maturation of thin spines into mushroom spines. Animal models of depression, autism, and stroke consistently show that rTMS increases spine density across multiple cortical layers.

### Molecular Mechanisms of Structural Change
The transition from magnetic pulse to structural growth is mediated by complex molecular cascades. A central player is **Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF)**, which rTMS significantly upregulates. BDNF binds to **TrkB** receptors, activating the PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK pathways—the primary intracellular signals for protein synthesis and cytoskeletal organization.

At the physical level, these pathways drive **actin polymerization**, pushing the neuronal membrane outward to form new filopodia. Maturation then follows as rTMS increases the expression of AMPA receptor subunits (GluR1, GluR2) and the scaffolding protein **PSD-95**. PSD-95 acts as the "glue" that stabilizes receptors within the membrane, transforming wobbly, plastic thin spines into stable mushroom spines.

Interestingly, increased spine density is often observed regardless of whether excitatory (high-frequency) or inhibitory (low-frequency) protocols are used. This suggests that rTMS does not merely "turn the volume up or down" but rather enhances the overall structural potential for adaptation, making the brain "structurally ready" to reorganize.

### Pruning and Homeostasis
Structural plasticity also encompasses the elimination of redundant or weak connections. While mature BDNF promotes growth, its precursor, **proBDNF**, binds to the **p75NTR** receptor to promote spine shrinkage and pruning. This mechanism is particularly relevant in conditions like autism, where rTMS may help normalize abnormally high spine densities. Thus, rTMS acts as a modulator rather than a simple growth factor, pruning the "bad" and strengthening the "good" to restore circuit efficiency.

Section 1.2: Structural Plasticity & Dendritic Spines
"Now, let's look at the target: the dendritic spine.

If you look at Figure 1 in the paper, you will see we categorize spines by shape. This isn't just aesthetics; shape predicts function:

Filopodia: These are long, thin, and lack a head. They are essentially 'feelers' exploring the environment. They are immature and highly plastic.
Thin Spines: These have a small head and a long neck. They are 'learning' spines—plastic and capable of change.
Mushroom Spines: These have a large head and a narrow neck. They are 'memory' spines—stable, strong, and containing a high density of receptors (AMPA/NMDA).
Stubby Spines: These lack a distinct neck; they are somewhat intermediate.
Why this matters:
When rTMS induces 'plasticity,' we are essentially pushing the system to create more spines (spinogenesis) or convert Thin spines into Mushroom spines (maturation). We are looking for the physical manifestation of 'learning' induced by our magnetic pulse."

Section 1.4.1: Effects on Spinogenesis (The Birth of Spines)
"Let's dive into the data. Does rTMS make new spines?
Looking at Table 1, which summarizes various animal studies, the answer is a resounding yes. Across different models—depression, autism, stroke—rTMS generally increases spine density.

Mechanism:
How does a magnetic pulse tell a cell to grow a spine? It triggers molecular cascades:

BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor): This is a key protein. Imagine it as fertilizer for the brain. rTMS upregulates BDNF.
Signaling Pathways: BDNF binds to its receptor TrkB, which activates the PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK pathways. These are the intracellular highways that tell the nucleus to start building proteins for new spines.
Actin Polymerization: At the physical level, spines are made of actin filaments. rTMS appears to promote actin polymerization, pushing the membrane out to form a new filopodium.
Nuance:
Interestingly, we see this increase in spines regardless of whether we use high-frequency (excitatory) or low-frequency (inhibitory) protocols. This suggests that rTMS is not just 'turning the volume up or down,' but rather enhancing the potential for plasticity. It is making the brain more 'structurally ready' to adapt."

Section 1.4.2: Effects on Remodeling & Maturation (Strengthening Connections)
"Creating a spine is step one. Step two is making it useful. This involves maturation.

Silent Synapses & AMPA Receptors:
Many new spines are 'silent'—they have NMDA receptors but lack AMPA receptors. For the spine to transmit a strong signal, it must insert AMPA receptors.
Several studies in this review show that rTMS increases the expression of GluR1 and GluR2 (subunits of the AMPA receptor). Furthermore, we see upregulation of PSD-95.

The Role of PSD-95:
Think of PSD-95 as the 'glue' or the 'scaffold' of the synapse. When rTMS increases PSD-95, it stabilizes the AMPA receptors in the membrane. This transforms a wobbly, plastic Thin spine into a stable, strong Mushroom spine.

The Confusion Point:
Here is where it gets tricky. Some studies show rTMS increases mushroom spines (stabilizing connections), while others show a decrease in mushroom spines but an increase in thin spines.
Interpretation: This likely depends on the disease state. In a healthy brain, rTMS might promote stability. In a 'rigid' or pathological brain (like in some autism models where connections are too dense/rigid), rTMS might actually destabilize old, overly-strong connections to allow for new learning. It is a push toward homeostasis."

Section 1.4.3: Effects on Pruning & Elimination (Cleaning House)
"We cannot talk about growth without talking about death. Synaptic pruning is essential.

If we only grew spines, our brains would become 'noisy' or epileptic. rTMS also helps eliminate weak or redundant connections.

Mechanism: This often involves LTD (Long-Term Depression) mechanisms. If a spine doesn't get enough activity, it retracts.
ProBDNF: While mature BDNF grows spines, its precursor, proBDNF, binds to a different receptor (p75NTR) and actually promotes spine shrinkage and pruning.
Clinical Relevance: The review cites studies where rTMS reduced spine density in models of Autism (where spine density is often abnormally high). This is crucial: rTMS is not just a 'builder'; it is a 'modulator.' It prunes the bad and grows the good."
Section 1.4.4: Bridging the Gap (The Synthesis)
"This is the most important conceptual section.
Traditionally, researchers study 'functional plasticity' (electrophysiology) in one lab and 'structural plasticity' (histology) in another. This review argues they are the same process viewed at different scales.

The molecular bridge is the signaling cascades (PI3K/Akt, MAPK, CaMKII). When rTMS stimulates the brain, it triggers these pathways.

Immediate effect: Changes in receptor phosphorylation (Functional).
Intermediate effect: Actin remodeling, spine head enlargement (Structural).
Long-term effect: Gene transcription, protein synthesis, permanent spine creation or removal (Structural consolidation of functional change).
If you only measure the electrical signal (functional), you miss the physical rewiring. If you only count spines (structural), you miss the immediate electrophysiological need that drove the change. rTMS drives both."

Part 3: Highlights of Common Confusion
As we review these findings, there are three areas where students often stumble:

The Paradox of "Excitatory" rTMS causing Inhibition (or vice versa):

Confusion: You might see a paper labeled "Inhibitory rTMS (1 Hz)" that results in more spines. Shouldn't inhibition mean less growth?
Clarification: "Inhibitory" refers to the net firing rate of a population of neurons measured at the surface (MEP). However, at the cellular level, "inhibition" often involves activating inhibitory interneurons. The plastic response to that inhibition (the homeostatic counter-reaction) might involve growing new excitatory spines to compensate. Don't equate "low frequency stimulation" with "atrophy." It often triggers growth as a compensatory mechanism.
The Term "Universal Modulator":

Confusion: This sounds like rTMS does the same thing everywhere.
Clarification: It does not. "Universal" means the mechanism (plasticity pathways like BDNF/TrkB) is available in all neurons. The outcome (grow vs. shrink, excite vs. inhibit) depends entirely on the initial state of the tissue. If the brain is hypoactive (depression), rTMS pushes it up. If it is hyperconnected (autism), it might push it down. It is a universal tool for homeostasis, not a universal direction.
Disease Models vs. Healthy Brains:

Confusion: Results vary wildly between the papers cited (Table 1).
Clarification: Pay close attention to the "Animal Model" column. rTMS in a healthy mouse might look very different from rTMS in a mouse with chronic stress. Plasticity mechanisms are often dormant in a stable, healthy environment but 'awakened' when the system is stressed or diseased. This is the "metaplasticity" concept—the plasticity of plasticity.
