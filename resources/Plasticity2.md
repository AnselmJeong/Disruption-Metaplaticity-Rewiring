# ECT-Induced Neuroplasticity and the Metaplastic Window: Molecular, Cellular, and Systems-Level Mechanisms

Electroconvulsive therapy remains the most efficacious intervention for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder, yet its mechanisms have only recently begun to yield to molecular and cellular interrogation. **The "metaplastic window" hypothesis proposes that ECT induces a time-limited period of enhanced neural plasticity—spanning hours to days—during which pathological circuits become amenable to adaptive restructuring.** This framework integrates decades of research on neurotrophic signaling, synaptic remodeling, epigenetic reprogramming, and glial contributions into a coherent mechanistic model. The convergence of multiple plasticity-promoting cascades creates what may be understood as a neurobiological opportunity for therapeutic change, explaining both the rapidity of ECT's effects compared to pharmacotherapy and the importance of treatment spacing. This report synthesizes evidence from human ECT studies and animal electroconvulsive seizure (ECS) models to delineate the molecular architecture underlying this metaplastic priming phenomenon.

## BDNF signaling orchestrates the primary neurotrophic cascade

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) occupies a central position in ECT's mechanism of action, with electroconvulsive seizures producing the most robust BDNF upregulation of any psychiatric intervention studied to date. The BDNF signaling cascade initiates when mature BDNF binds the tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) receptor, inducing receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation at intracellular tyrosine residues Y490, Y515, and Y816 (Minichiello, 2009). This phosphorylation activates three major downstream pathways that collectively promote neuronal survival, synaptic strengthening, and gene transcription essential for sustained plasticity.

The **MAPK/ERK pathway** represents the primary transcriptional arm of BDNF signaling. Phosphorylated Y515 recruits the Shc/Grb2/SOS adapter complex, activating the canonical Ras → Raf → MEK → ERK1/2 cascade. Nuclear translocation of ERK phosphorylates cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) at Ser133, initiating transcription of plasticity genes including *c-fos*, *Arc*, *Egr1*, and BDNF itself—creating a positive feedback loop (Nibuya et al., 1995). Animal studies demonstrate robust ERK phosphorylation in hippocampus within 30-60 minutes post-ECS, peaking at 2-4 hours and returning to baseline by 24 hours.

The **PI3K/Akt pathway** mediates cell survival signaling critical for neuroprotection. Phosphorylated Y515 also recruits IRS-1/2, activating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). The resulting PIP3 generation recruits Akt to the membrane, where PDK1 and mTORC2 phosphorylate it at Thr308 and Ser473, respectively. Activated Akt inhibits glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) through Ser9 phosphorylation, promoting neuronal survival and β-catenin stabilization. The downstream activation of mTOR enhances protein synthesis required for synaptic plasticity consolidation (Duman & Voleti, 2012).

The **PLCγ pathway** couples BDNF signaling to calcium-dependent mechanisms essential for synaptic modification. Phosphorylated Y816 directly activates phospholipase C-γ1, which cleaves PIP2 into diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol trisphosphate (IP3). IP3-triggered calcium release from endoplasmic reticulum stores activates calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), the molecular switch critical for long-term potentiation (LTP) induction. This pathway is particularly relevant to ECT's metaplastic effects, as CaMKII autophosphorylation at Thr286 creates molecular memory of prior activation.

### Temporal dynamics of BDNF upregulation reveal treatment-relevant kinetics

The time course of BDNF changes following ECT has been characterized across multiple biological compartments. In human serum studies, meta-analysis by Brunoni et al. (2014) demonstrated that ECT significantly increases serum BDNF with an effect size of Hedges' g = 0.56 (95% CI: 0.30-0.82). Individual studies report **30-100% increases** from baseline following a typical 6-12 session ECT course, with levels remaining elevated for approximately one week post-completion before gradually returning toward baseline over subsequent months (Rocha et al., 2016). Notably, lower baseline BDNF predicts better ECT response, and BDNF increases correlate with Hamilton Depression Rating Scale improvement (r = -0.54) (Piccinni et al., 2009).

Animal ECS studies provide superior temporal resolution for brain tissue changes. The seminal work of Nibuya et al. (1995) demonstrated that chronic ECS (10 daily treatments) increases hippocampal BDNF mRNA **3-4 fold**, with effects most pronounced in the dentate gyrus. Regional and temporal specificity varies systematically:

| Brain Region | mRNA Peak | Protein Peak | Magnitude |
|--------------|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| Hippocampus (DG) | 2-4 hours | 12-24 hours | 2-5 fold |
| Hippocampus (CA1/CA3) | 2-6 hours | 12-24 hours | 1.5-3 fold |
| Prefrontal cortex | 4-6 hours | 24-48 hours | 1.5-2 fold |
| Amygdala | 2-4 hours | 12-24 hours | 1.5-2.5 fold |

Single ECS produces transient BDNF elevation returning to baseline within 24-48 hours, whereas repeated ECS produces progressive accumulation with sustained elevation persisting at least two weeks after final treatment (Newton et al., 2003). This distinction between acute and chronic effects parallels the clinical observation that therapeutic response typically emerges after 4-6 ECT sessions.

### The Val66Met polymorphism modulates activity-dependent BDNF secretion

The functional single nucleotide polymorphism rs6265 (Val66Met) in the BDNF gene has attracted considerable attention as a potential predictor of ECT response. The Met allele disrupts BDNF interaction with sortilin, impairing trafficking to the regulated secretory pathway and reducing activity-dependent BDNF release by approximately 25-30%, while constitutive secretion remains relatively unaffected (Egan et al., 2003).

Clinical studies examining Val66Met effects on ECT response have yielded inconsistent results. Huuhka et al. (2007) reported that Met carriers showed poorer ECT response in Finnish patients, while Domschke et al. (2010) found Val/Val genotype associated with better ECT response in major depressive disorder. However, Bousman et al. (2014) meta-analysis showed only a non-significant trend toward Val/Val superiority, and Okazaki et al. (2019) found no significant association in Japanese patients. This inconsistency likely reflects small effect sizes, ethnic heterogeneity, and methodological differences. Currently, BDNF genotyping is not recommended for routine clinical decision-making, though it may eventually contribute to polygenic risk scores for ECT response prediction.

## Complementary neurotrophic factors expand the plasticity response

While BDNF dominates the neurotrophic literature, ECT induces a coordinated upregulation of multiple growth factors that collectively create a permissive environment for neural plasticity. Each factor contributes distinct mechanisms to the overall neuroplastic response.

**Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)** links angiogenesis to neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Newton et al. (2003) demonstrated **2-3 fold** VEGF mRNA upregulation in rat hippocampus within 2-6 hours post-ECS, with Segi-Nishida et al. (2008) localizing expression to dentate gyrus granule cells. VEGF signaling through VEGFR-2 (Flk-1/KDR) on neural progenitor cells activates PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK pathways, promoting proliferation and survival. Critically, Warner-Schmidt and Duman (2007) demonstrated that blocking VEGF signaling attenuates ECS-induced neurogenesis, establishing VEGF as a necessary mediator. The coupling of angiogenesis and neurogenesis creates a permissive vascular niche in the subgranular zone essential for progenitor cell proliferation.

**Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2)** serves as a potent mitogen for neural progenitor cells, with particularly rapid and sustained induction following ECS. Gwinn et al. (2002) reported **2-4 fold** hippocampal FGF-2 protein increases after repeated ECS, with effects persisting up to 72 hours. Astrocytes represent the primary source of FGF-2 in adult brain, and their activation following ECS amplifies trophic support for newly generated neurons (Gomez-Pinilla et al., 1995). FGF-2 signaling through FGFR1, with heparan sulfate proteoglycan co-receptors, maintains neural stem cells in a proliferative, undifferentiated state capable of responding to subsequent differentiation signals.

**Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)** modulates dopaminergic systems relevant to reward circuitry and motivation. Martin et al. (2009) demonstrated ECS increases GDNF expression in striatum and substantia nigra, with effects mediated through GFRα1/RET receptor signaling. Given dopaminergic dysfunction in anhedonia and psychomotor retardation, GDNF upregulation may contribute to improvement in specific depressive symptom domains.

The temporal coordination of these factors reveals an orchestrated response: VEGF peaks earliest (2-6 hours), followed by NGF (6-12 hours), with FGF-2 and GDNF showing more prolonged elevation (24-72 hours). This sequential activation suggests cascading mechanisms wherein early factors initiate proliferative responses while later factors support survival and differentiation.

## Immediate early genes mark the transition to sustained plasticity

The immediate early gene (IEG) response to ECT represents the initial transcriptional wave translating seizure activity into lasting molecular change. These genes encode transcription factors and effector proteins that bridge acute neural activation to sustained plasticity modifications.

**Arc/Arg3.1** (activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein) shows particularly robust induction, with mRNA increasing **8-12 fold** within 30 minutes post-ECS, peaking at 1-2 hours, and protein levels maximal at 2-4 hours (Lyford et al., 1995). Arc plays a critical role in AMPA receptor trafficking through interaction with endophilin 2/3 and dynamin, promoting receptor endocytosis and thereby regulating synaptic strength (Chowdhury et al., 2006). Paradoxically, Arc promotes both LTP consolidation (through synaptic tagging) and homeostatic scaling down (through AMPA receptor internalization), suggesting its role in establishing new synaptic setpoints rather than simply strengthening connections.

**c-Fos** shows the most dramatic induction, with mRNA increasing **10-50 fold** within 30-60 minutes, particularly in dentate gyrus and piriform cortex (Morgan et al., 1987). Regional activation patterns revealed by c-Fos mapping—with strongest induction in hippocampus, amygdala, and medial prefrontal cortex—correspond to circuits implicated in mood regulation. Importantly, chronic ECS attenuates the c-Fos response compared to acute treatment, suggesting adaptive changes in the transcriptional response that may relate to therapeutic tolerance or maintained efficacy (Morinobu et al., 1997).

**Homer1a** serves as a critical metaplasticity regulator. This short isoform acts as a dominant negative by disrupting Homer-mGluR scaffolding at the postsynaptic density, reducing mGluR-mediated calcium signaling (Brakeman et al., 1997). ECS produces **3-8 fold** Homer1a induction, with notably prolonged expression compared to other IEGs (detectable at 6+ hours). By uncoupling metabotropic glutamate receptors from downstream effectors, Homer1a effectively shifts the threshold for LTP/LTD induction—a molecular mechanism of metaplasticity directly relevant to the "metaplastic window" concept.

### Synaptic scaffolding proteins consolidate structural changes

Beyond transcription factors, ECT induces sustained changes in synaptic scaffolding proteins that stabilize new synaptic configurations. **PSD-95** (postsynaptic density protein 95), which anchors AMPA receptors through stargazin/TARP interaction, increases **30-50%** after chronic ECS in hippocampus (Stewart & Reid, 2000). **Synaptophysin**, a presynaptic vesicle marker, shows **20-40%** increases following repeated treatment, indicating enhanced presynaptic terminal density (Vaidya et al., 1999). SNARE complex proteins (SNAP-25, syntaxin-1, VAMP2) similarly increase **15-30%**, reflecting enhanced neurotransmitter release machinery.

Dendritic spine dynamics demonstrate the structural correlate of these molecular changes. Chronic ECS increases spine density by **25-40%** in hippocampal CA1, with similar effects in prefrontal cortex (Chen et al., 2009). Spine morphology analysis reveals initial increases in thin spines (highly plastic, learning-related) followed by maturation into mushroom spines (stable, representing consolidated connections) over 1-2 weeks. This progression from spinogenesis to spine maturation provides a structural timeline consistent with the clinical observation that therapeutic gains consolidate over weeks following ECT completion.

### Homeostatic synaptic scaling complements Hebbian mechanisms

Beyond Hebbian (associative) plasticity, homeostatic mechanisms respond to the massive perturbation of seizure activity. Synaptic scaling adjusts all synaptic strengths multiplicatively to maintain stable network activity, operating on a timescale of hours to days.

Following seizure-induced hyperactivity, scaling-down mechanisms reduce synaptic AMPA receptor content, decreasing miniature EPSC amplitude. Key molecular mediators include:

- **Arc**: Promotes AMPA receptor internalization; strongly induced by ECS
- **TNFα**: Released by glia; normally promotes scaling up; may contribute to recovery phase
- **Retinoic acid**: Synthesized during activity deprivation; promotes scaling up

The biphasic response—initial scaling down following seizure hyperactivity, followed by potential scaling up during post-ictal depression—may establish new homeostatic setpoints relevant to therapeutic mechanism. The metaplastic window may represent the transition period when these homeostatic mechanisms are actively recalibrating, creating a period of enhanced susceptibility to experience-dependent modification.

## Epigenetic modifications enable sustained transcriptional changes

The persistence of ECT's therapeutic effects beyond the acute treatment period requires mechanisms for sustained gene expression changes. Epigenetic modifications—histone acetylation, DNA methylation, and microRNA regulation—provide the molecular memory necessary for maintained plasticity.

### Histone acetylation promotes transcription-permissive chromatin states

ECS rapidly increases histone acetylation at plasticity-related gene promoters. Tsankova et al. (2004) demonstrated that ECS increases H3K14 acetylation at BDNF promoters (P3 and P4) **2-3 fold** within 2-24 hours in hippocampus. H3K9 acetylation and pan-H4 acetylation similarly increase in CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus, peaking at 2-4 hours and persisting up to 24 hours.

The enzymatic basis involves recruitment of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) to promoters. ECS activates CREB, which recruits CBP (CREB-binding protein) to target promoters. CBP's intrinsic HAT activity acetylates histones, loosening chromatin structure and permitting transcription factor access. Simultaneously, ECS reduces HDAC2 activity through CaMKII-mediated phosphorylation and nuclear export of Class II HDACs (HDAC4, HDAC5), releasing their repressive influence.

The therapeutic potential of HDAC inhibition has attracted considerable interest. Guan et al. (2009) demonstrated that HDAC2 negatively regulates memory formation and synaptic plasticity. HDAC inhibitors enhance BDNF induction and may potentiate ECT effects, with combined treatment producing synergistic increases (**up to 10-fold**) in BDNF expression.

### DNA methylation dynamics involve active demethylation

DNA methylation at CpG sites typically represses transcription, and ECS induces both methylation and demethylation events at specific loci. Ma et al. (2009) demonstrated that ECS activates Gadd45b-dependent DNA demethylation, facilitating expression of BDNF and other plasticity genes. BDNF exon IV promoter methylation decreases following ECS, correlating with increased transcription.

Particularly relevant is the discovery that ECS increases 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) levels through TET enzyme activation. Guo et al. (2011) showed that ECS increases global 5hmC by **10-20%** in hippocampal dentate gyrus, with effects peaking at 4-24 hours. TET1-mediated conversion of 5-methylcytosine to 5hmC serves both as an intermediate in active demethylation and as a stable epigenetic mark enriched at neuronal gene promoters. TET1 knockdown impairs ECS-induced gene expression changes, establishing this pathway as necessary for the transcriptional response.

### MicroRNA changes fine-tune post-transcriptional regulation

ECS modulates expression of plasticity-related microRNAs that regulate target mRNAs post-transcriptionally. **miR-132**, the most extensively studied activity-dependent miRNA, is strongly induced by ECS through CREB-dependent transcription, peaking at 2-4 hours and remaining elevated for 24 hours (Vo et al., 2005). miR-132 targets include MeCP2 (methyl-CpG binding protein 2) and p250GAP, promoting dendritic morphogenesis and synaptic plasticity. The related **miR-212**, transcribed from the same primary transcript, shows similar regulation.

**miR-134**, localized to dendritic spines, regulates spine morphology through targeting LIMK1 (Schratt et al., 2006). ECS modulation of miR-134 expression influences structural synaptic plasticity critical for consolidating new circuit configurations. The coordinated regulation of multiple miRNAs creates a post-transcriptional program supporting the broader plasticity response.

## Glial cells actively participate in plasticity mechanisms

Glial contributions to ECT mechanisms have gained increasing recognition as the "neurocentric" view of brain function has expanded to include astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocyte precursor cells as active participants in neural plasticity.

신경과학의 전통적인 관점에서 **글리아 세포(Glial cells)**는 단순히 뉴런을 보조하고 영양을 공급하는 '풀(glue)' 같은 존재로 여겨졌습니다. 하지만 최근의 연구들은 성상교세포(Astrocytes)와 미세아교세포(Microglia)가 **시냅스 가소성(Synaptic Plasticity)**의 핵심적인 주역임을 입증하고 있습니다.

글리아 세포가 신경가소성에 능동적으로 참여한다는 주요 증거들을 정리해 드립니다.

------

## 1. 삼자 시냅스(Tripartite Synapse) 가소성

가장 강력한 증거는 **성상교세포(Astrocytes)**의 역할입니다. 현대 신경과학은 시냅스를 '뉴런-뉴런'의 결합이 아닌, '전시냅스-후시냅스-성상교세포'가 결합된 **삼자 시냅스** 구조로 정의합니다.

- **글루타메이트 조절:** 성상교세포는 시냅스 틈새의 글루타메이트 농도를 조절하여 신호의 강도를 결정합니다.
- **글리오전달물질(Gliotransmitters) 방출:** 성상교세포는 내부의 $Ca^{2+}$ 농도가 높아지면 **D-serine, ATP, Glutamate** 같은 물질을 방출합니다. 특히 D-serine은 NMDA 수용체의 필수 공통 작용제(co-agonist)로 작용하여 **장기 강화(LTP, Long-Term Potentiation)**를 유도하는 데 필수적입니다.

------

## 2. 미세아교세포에 의한 시냅스 가지치기(Synaptic Pruning)

**미세아교세포(Microglia)**는 뇌의 면역 세포일 뿐만 아니라, 필요 없는 시냅스를 물리적으로 제거하여 회로를 재구성하는 능동적인 가소성 조절자입니다.

- **보체 시스템 이용:** 미세아교세포는 C1q, C3와 같은 보체 단백질이 표지된 '약한 시냅스'를 인식하고 포식 작용(phagocytosis)을 통해 제거합니다.
- **발달 및 학습:** 이는 뇌 발달 단계뿐만 아니라 성인기 학습 과정에서도 중요한데, 새로운 기억이 저장될 공간을 마련하기 위해 기존의 불필요한 연결을 끊어내는 역할을 합니다.

------

## 4. 구조적 가소성 유도 (Secreted Factors)

글리아 세포는 다양한 인자를 분비하여 뉴런의 물리적 구조 변화를 촉진합니다.

- **BDNF 및 사이토카인:** 글리아 세포에서 분비되는 **BDNF(뇌유래신경영양인자)**는 뉴런의 수상돌기 가시(Dendritic spine) 형성을 촉진합니다.
- **TNF-α와 시냅스 스케일링:** 미세아교세포와 성상교세포에서 분비되는 TNF-α는 시냅스의 전체적인 강도를 조절하는 '시냅스 스케일링(Synaptic scaling)'에 관여하여 신경망의 항상성을 유지합니다.



### Astrocytes support synaptic plasticity through multiple mechanisms

Astrocyte activation following ECS, marked by GFAP upregulation (**150-200%** at 24 hours), involves both proliferation and hypertrophy (Wennström et al., 2006). Functionally, astrocytes contribute to ECT mechanisms through:

**Glutamate-glutamine cycling**: ECS upregulates GLT-1 (EAAT2) expression by **40-60%**, enhancing glutamate clearance capacity and sharpening synaptic transmission (Bhagya et al., 2015). Enhanced glutamine synthetase activity following the acute phase supports neurotransmitter precursor supply.

**D-serine release**: Astrocytes provide D-serine, the primary NMDA receptor co-agonist at forebrain synapses. ECS increases serine racemase expression **30-50%**, elevating extracellular D-serine and enhancing NMDA receptor function essential for LTP (Henneberger et al., 2010).

**Neurotrophic factor secretion**: Astrocytes contribute substantially to the BDNF pool and release FGF-2 and GDNF following activation.

**Metabolic support**: Enhanced lactate shuttling through upregulated monocarboxylate transporters (MCT1/MCT4) supports neuronal energy demands during plasticity.

### Microglia adopt neuroprotective phenotypes

Rather than classical pro-inflammatory activation, ECS induces microglia toward an "alternative" (M2-like) state characterized by anti-inflammatory cytokine profiles. While IL-6 shows acute elevation (**300-400%** at 2-6 hours), TNFα changes minimally, and anti-inflammatory IL-10 increases (**150-200%** at 24-48 hours) (Jansson et al., 2012). This profile—supported by increased CD206 and Arg1 expression—suggests neuroprotective rather than neurotoxic activation.

Microglia also contribute to synaptic refinement through complement-mediated phagocytosis. Modest C1q and C3 activation following ECS enables selective elimination of weak synapses while preserving active connections. Quantitative estimates suggest **~5-10%** of hippocampal synapses show microglial contact post-ECS, with **~2-3%** of contacted synapses undergoing elimination—a refinement rather than loss process.

### Oligodendrocyte precursor proliferation supports white matter plasticity

Wennström et al. (2004) demonstrated that ECS stimulates oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) proliferation, with BrdU+/NG2+ cells increasing **2-3 fold** in hippocampus. OPC differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes observed at 1-4 weeks, combined with increased myelin basic protein expression, suggests potential for activity-dependent myelination.

Human neuroimaging supports these findings. DTI studies demonstrate increased fractional anisotropy in corpus callosum and frontal-limbic tracts following ECT (Jorgensen et al., 2016), consistent with enhanced white matter integrity.

## The integrated metaplastic window concept has clinical implications

The convergence of molecular, cellular, and systems-level evidence supports a model wherein ECT induces a time-limited period of enhanced neural plasticity—the metaplastic window—during which pathological circuits become amenable to adaptive restructuring. Understanding temporal parameters and individual variation has direct implications for clinical practice.

### Temporal boundaries span hours to days

Based on molecular marker kinetics and electrophysiological evidence, the metaplastic window following individual ECT sessions spans approximately **24-72 hours**, with onset at 6-12 hours post-treatment as homeostatic mechanisms engage. Molecular markers defining this window include:

- BDNF protein elevation (peaks 12-24 hours, sustained 48-72 hours)
- NMDA receptor subunit ratio shift (12-48 hours)
- Enhanced LTP inducibility in hippocampal slices (persists 3-5 days)
- IEG protein products (sustained hours to days)
- Epigenetic modifications (hours to weeks depending on mark)

### Overlapping windows explain treatment spacing rationale

Standard ECT scheduling (3 times weekly) creates overlapping plasticity windows, with each session's window (3-7 days) extending into the subsequent treatment. This produces:

- Cumulative BDNF increases across treatment courses
- Sustained elevation of plasticity-related transcription
- Progressive hippocampal volume increases requiring 6-8 sessions

Treatment frequency studies support this framework. Kellner et al. (2006) demonstrated that 3 times weekly ECT produces superior outcomes to weekly treatment for acute depression, consistent with the importance of maintaining window overlap. Conversely, spacing closer than 48 hours may cause excessive glutamate release and seizure threshold changes without enhanced efficacy.

### Adjunctive treatment timing may optimize outcomes

The metaplastic window concept suggests that adjunctive interventions—cognitive rehabilitation, psychotherapy, pharmacological enhancement—may be optimally effective during the 24-72 hour post-ECT period. While empirical evidence remains limited, theoretical considerations support:

- **Cognitive rehabilitation**: Days 2-5 post-individual session may optimize procedural learning during enhanced plasticity
- **Psychotherapy**: Extinction learning and memory reconsolidation-based approaches may benefit from the plasticity window
- **Ketamine augmentation**: Sequential or combined ketamine-ECT protocols leverage convergent BDNF and plasticity mechanisms, though optimal timing remains under investigation



### Structural imaging validates the plasticity model

Human MRI studies provide macroscopic validation of ECT-induced plasticity. The GEMRIC consortium analysis of 281 patients demonstrated robust hippocampal volume increases, with dentate gyrus showing greatest change (Oltedal et al., 2018). Volume increases of **2-5%** correlate with clinical improvement (r = 0.4-0.6) (Tendolkar et al., 2013) and persist weeks to months following treatment completion.

Importantly, these volume changes likely reflect multiple cellular processes: neurogenesis (primarily dentate gyrus), dendritic arborization and synaptogenesis, glial proliferation, and angiogenesis. The convergence of human neuroimaging with animal histological evidence creates a translational bridge supporting the mechanistic framework outlined in this report.
