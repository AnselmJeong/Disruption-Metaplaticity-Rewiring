## Executive Summary

The neurotrophic hypothesis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) has evolved from a simplistic deficit model to a complex framework emphasizing the dynamic interplay between Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) isoforms and their specific receptor cascades. While the pathophysiology of MDD is characterized by reduced neuronal plasticity and hippocampal atrophy driven by diminished BDNF availability ([DOI: 10.1016/S0006-3223(97](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0006-3223(97))00469-6), therapeutic efficacy is critically dependent on the proteolytic cleavage of the precursor proBDNF into mature BDNF (mBDNF). This molecular distinction is paramount because proBDNF preferentially binds to the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) complexed with sortilin, activating RhoA signaling pathways that facilitate long-term depression (LTD) and neuronal apoptosis ([DOI: 10.1038/nn1523](https://doi.org/10.1038/nn1523)). Conversely, mBDNF exhibits high affinity for tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), initiating canonical pro-survival cascades that promote synaptic integrity ([DOI: 10.1038/nrn1201](https://doi.org/10.1038/nrn1201)). Therefore, the modulation of depressive symptoms appears contingent upon shifting the intracellular balance away from p75NTR-mediated apoptosis toward TrkB-mediated neuroplasticity, rather than merely increasing total BDNF levels.

Beyond molecular distinctiveness, the spatial regulation of BDNF signaling significantly influences antidepressant outcomes, necessitating a distinction between compartmentalized dendritic release and systemic biomarker changes. BDNF exerts its neuromodulatory effects through highly localized release mechanisms driven by activity-dependent mRNA translation within dendrites, a process essential for synapse-specific plasticity that is not adequately captured by peripheral serum measurements ([DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2681-08.2008](https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2681-08.2008)). Current pharmacotherapies are often limited by their inability to rapidly induce this local synaptic restoration in cortico-limbic circuits, despite eventual systemic increases in BDNF ([DOI: 10.1016/j.biopsych.2014.06.007](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2014.06.007)). Consequently, the emerging paradigm for treatment-resistant depression focuses on therapeutic strategies that selectively enhance mBDNF processing and facilitate local dendritic trafficking, thereby addressing the temporal and spatial deficits in synaptic connectivity that underlie the delayed onset of action observed in conventional treatments.



## The Neurotrophic Hypothesis and the BDNF Isoform Axis

The neurotrophic hypothesis of depression posits that the pathophysiology of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is characterized by a reduction in neuronal plasticity and atrophy of specific limbic structures, most notably the hippocampus, driven largely by diminished availability of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) ([DOI: 10.1016/S0006-3223(97](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0006-3223(97))00469-6). However, this conceptual framework has evolved significantly with the characterization of the BDNF isoform axis, which necessitates a distinction between the effects of the precursor protein, proBDNF, and its mature proteolytic product, mBDNF. The synthesis of BDNF is a highly regulated process initiated by the translation of the *BDNF* gene, which comprises multiple 5' non-coding exons spliced to a common coding exon (IX); this genomic architecture facilitates complex, activity-dependent transcriptional regulation, allowing distinct signaling pathways to differentially modulate BDNF expression in response to physiological and pathological stimuli ([DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2810-07.2007](https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2810-07.2007)).

Following translation, the nascent polypeptide is synthesized as preproBDNF, which is cleaved in the endoplasmic reticulum to form proBDNF. The subsequent processing of proBDNF into mature BDNF (mBDNF) is a critical determinant of neurotrophic function. While intracellular conversion occurs within the secretory pathway via furin and prohormone convertases, extracellular cleavage is mediated by plasminogen activators, such as tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), thereby linking synaptic activity to the local availability of mBDNF ([DOI: 10.1126/science.1102940](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1102940)). The functional dichotomy between these isoforms arises from their distinct receptor affinities and downstream signaling cascades: mBDNF binds with high affinity to the tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), triggering dimerization and autophosphorylation that activate the MAPK/ERK, PI3K/Akt, and PLC-γ pathways, which are critical for neuronal survival, differentiation, and synaptic potentiation ([DOI: 10.1038/nrn1496](https://doi.org/10.1038/nrn1496)). Conversely, proBDNF preferentially binds to the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), often requiring the co-receptor sortilin for high-affinity binding. The activation of p75NTR initiates signaling cascades involving RhoA and JNK, which can induce apoptosis, growth cone collapse, and synaptic weakening via long-term depression (LTD) ([DOI: 10.1038/nrn2277](https://doi.org/10.1038/nrn2277)).

Consequently, the balance between proBDNF and mBDNF serves as a molecular switch governing synaptic plasticity, where the proteolytic cleavage efficiency determines the direction of synaptic modification ([DOI: 10.1016/j.neuron.2004.05.004](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2004.05.004)). In the context of MDD pathophysiology, evidence suggests that stress and depressive states may disrupt the processing of BDNF, potentially favoring the accumulation of proBDNF and the suppression of mBDNF signaling. Preclinical studies indicate that chronic stress downregulates tPA activity, thereby reducing the conversion of proBDNF to mBDNF and precipitating synaptic deficits ([DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3769-08.2008](https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3769-08.2008)). Furthermore, alterations in the intracellular trafficking of BDNF, influenced by the common Val66Met polymorphism (rs6265), have been implicated in MDD, as the Met variant impairs activity-dependent secretion of BDNF, rendering carriers more susceptible to stress-induced atrophy ([DOI: 10.1016/j.neuron.2005.11.020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2005.11.020)). While clinical measurement of total BDNF levels in peripheral blood is a common proxy, studies increasingly emphasize that the ratio of proBDNF to mBDNF may provide greater specificity for diagnosing depressive states and predicting treatment response, as total BDNF often fails to capture the critical functional imbalance in receptor signaling ([DOI: 10.1016/j.biopsych.2010.06.018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2010.06.018)). This methodological limitation may contribute to the inconsistencies observed in serum BDNF studies across different patient cohorts, highlighting the necessity of isoform-specific assays in future research ([DOI: 10.1016/j.psychres.2011.04.033](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2011.04.033)).

## Divergent Receptor Signaling: TrkB versus p75NTR Cascades

The functional dichotomy of neurotrophin signaling is principally governed by the competitive engagement of the tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) and the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), which exert opposing influences on neuronal integrity and synaptic architecture ([DOI: 10.1038/nrn1201](https://doi.org/10.1038/nrn1201)). While TrkB activation initiates canonical pro-survival cascades, p75NTR signaling frequently invokes apoptotic machinery, suggesting that the intracellular downstream balance between these receptors is a critical determinant of cellular fate in mood disorders. TrkB signaling is predominantly mediated through the autophosphorylation of specific intracellular tyrosine residues, which serve as docking sites for adaptor proteins that subsequently activate the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ERK pathways ([DOI: 10.1016/j.neuron.2014.02.018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2014.02.018)). Activation of the PI3K/Akt cascade is essential for neuronal survival as it inhibits pro-apoptotic factors such as BAD and caspase-9, whereas the MAPK/ERK pathway facilitates synaptic plasticity and long-term potentiation (LTP) through the phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) ([DOI: 10.1038/sj.mp.4001615](https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.mp.4001615)). Clinical and preclinical evidence indicates that the therapeutic efficacy of antidepressants, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), is contingent upon the upregulation of this TrkB-mediated signaling; behavioral effects of these pharmacological agents are abolished in conditional TrkB knockout mice, highlighting the non-negotiable role of this receptor in therapeutic response ([DOI: 10.1016/S0006-3223(02](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0006-3223(02))01370-9).

Conversely, p75NTR signaling acts as a modulator of neuronal pruning and apoptosis, particularly in the context of stress or neurodegenerative processes where proneurotrophins are upregulated. When p75NTR is activated, it recruits Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors to activate RhoA, a small GTPase that induces growth cone collapse and inhibition of neurite outgrowth by stabilizing actin-myosin contractility ([DOI: 10.1073/pnas.0505552102](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0505552102)). Furthermore, p75NTR interacts with intracellular adaptor proteins such as NRIF and TRAF6 to stimulate the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, a cascade strongly associated with the induction of programmed cell death and synaptic regression ([DOI: 10.1016/S0896-6273(03](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0896-6273(03))00256-8). In the pathophysiology of depression, heightened p75NTR expression is thought to contribute to the atrophy observed in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Consequently, successful antidepressant therapy appears to require not only the potentiation of TrkB signaling but also the concurrent suppression of the p75NTR-RhoA/JNK axis to restore neurotrophic balance ([DOI: 10.1016/j.biopsych.2009.02.017](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2009.02.017)). However, the role of p75NTR in depression remains complex, as some studies suggest that p75NTR signaling is necessary for the structural plasticity induced by rapid-acting antidepressants like ketamine, challenging the simplistic view of p75NTR as purely detrimental and raising controversy regarding whether therapeutic strategies should aim to inhibit or modulate this receptor ([DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4660-11.2012](https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4660-11.2012)).

## Compartmentalized Release Dynamics: Dendritic Localization vs. Systemic Levels

The neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) exerts its neuromodulatory effects through highly compartmentalized release mechanisms that are spatially restricted to subcellular domains, a process critical for synaptic plasticity. Unlike indiscriminate volumetric transmission, BDNF signaling is often regulated via local mRNA translation within dendrites, allowing for rapid, synapse-specific responses to neuronal activity ([DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2681-08.2008](https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2681-08.2008)). This dendritic targeting is mediated by distinct cis-acting elements in the BDNF mRNA 3' untranslated region, which facilitate transport to distal compartments where activity-dependent translation occurs ([DOI: 10.1038/nn1093](https://doi.org/10.1038/nn1093)). Mechanistically, the secretion of BDNF from dendrites relies on a regulated pathway distinct from constitutive release, involving the fusion of dense-core vesicles in a calcium-dependent manner that is triggered by specific patterns of action potentials ([DOI: 10.1016/j.neuron.2013.08.024](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2013.08.024)). This localized release is indispensable for long-term potentiation (LTP); specifically, the acute application of BDNF to hippocampal slices facilitates LTP induction, while the blockade of TrkB receptors impairs it, underscoring the necessity of autocrine and paracrine BDNF signaling for the stabilization of synaptic strengthening ([DOI: 10.1126/science.1102132](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1102132)). Furthermore, compartmentalized BDNF signaling is essential for the plasticity of individual synapses, with local release acting as a gating mechanism for spine-specific potentiation, effectively converting short-term potentiation into long-lasting functional changes ([DOI: 10.1016/j.neuron.2016.02.035](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2016.02.035)). Conversely, BDNF is also implicated in long-term depression (LTD), where low-frequency stimulation induces a distinct mode of release that facilitates the weakening of synaptic connections, highlighting the bidirectional capacity of neurotrophin signaling in metaplasticity ([DOI: 10.1002/(SICI](https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI))1098-1063(1999)9:4<354::AID-HIPO5>3.0.CO;2-0).

In stark contrast to the precise spatial dynamics observed at the synaptic level, clinical psychiatric research relies heavily on quantifying BDNF in peripheral compartments—primarily serum or plasma—as a proxy for central nervous system activity. This approach faces significant methodological and physiological limitations regarding its validity as a biomarker for central synaptic changes. A primary confounding factor is that a substantial proportion of circulating BDNF is stored and released by platelets rather than crossing the blood-brain barrier from the brain, raising questions about the extent to which peripheral levels reflect central synthesis ([DOI: 10.1046/j.1471-4159.2002.00824.x](https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1471-4159.2002.00824.x)). While some studies have reported positive correlations between serum and cortical BDNF levels ([DOI: 10.1007/s00406-009-0026-9](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00406-009-0026-9)), others have failed to replicate this association, suggesting that peripheral measurements may not reliably track central fluctuations during pharmacological treatment ([DOI: 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2010.05.005](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2010.05.005)). The utility of systemic BDNF as a state marker is further complicated by high intra-individual variability; meta-analytic evidence indicates that peripheral levels are influenced by diurnal rhythms, seasonal changes, and physical activity, which can obscure treatment-specific effects ([DOI: 10.1038/mp.2013.187](https://doi.org/10.1038/mp.2013.187)). Additionally, the discrepancy between serum and plasma BDNF concentrations—often differing by orders of magnitude—creates inconsistency in the literature regarding whether BDNF levels increase, decrease, or remain unchanged following antidepressant therapy ([DOI: 10.1038/mp.2014.127](https://doi.org/10.1038/mp.2014.127)). Consequently, while peripheral BDNF measurements offer a non-invasive clinical tool, their ability to inform on the dendritic release dynamics governing LTP and LTD remains limited by the inability of systemic assays to capture the localized, compartment-specific signaling that underpins synaptic efficacy.

## Mechanisms of Action: Therapeutic Modulation of BDNF Processing

The therapeutic efficacy of antidepressant interventions is critically mediated by the dynamic modulation of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) processing, specifically the proteolytic cleavage of proBDNF to mature BDNF (mBDNF). The precursor, proBDNF, preferentially binds to the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) complexed with sortilin, activating RhoA signaling pathways that facilitate long-term depression (LTD) and neuronal apoptosis ([DOI: 10.1038/nn1523](https://doi.org/10.1038/nn1523)). Conversely, mBDNF exhibits high affinity for the tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), triggering downstream PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK cascades that promote synaptic potentiation, neuronal survival, and dendritic spine formation ([DOI: 10.1126/science.1097436](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1097436)). Psychopharmacological and neuromodulatory interventions appear to exert their restorative effects, in part, by shifting this balance from pro-apoptotic proBDNF/p75NTR signaling toward pro-survival mBDNF/TrkB signaling.

Monoamine-based pharmacotherapies, particularly Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) and Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs), regulate this proteolytic system through both transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms. Chronic administration of antidepressants such as fluoxetine has been shown to upregulate the expression of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) in the hippocampus, the primary serine protease responsible for converting extracellular proBDNF to mBDNF ([DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3680-05.2006](https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3680-05.2006)). By enhancing tPA activity, these agents facilitate the cleavage of proBDNF, thereby increasing the local availability of mBDNF and promoting TrkB-mediated synaptic plasticity ([DOI: 10.1038/sj.npp.1301534](https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.npp.1301534)). Furthermore, evidence suggests that antidepressants may modulate intracellular convertases, such as furin, favoring the secretion of mBDNF directly from the trans-Golgi network rather than releasing the precursor for extracellular processing ([DOI: 10.1124/mol.108.051514](https://doi.org/10.1124/mol.108.051514)). This dual regulation ensures a sustained elevation of trophic support, countering the atrophic effects observed in mood disorders.

Rapid-acting agents, most notably the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist ketamine, engage the BDNF system through a distinct, temporally compressed mechanism that relies on the acute release of existing BDNF pools rather than de novo synthesis. Preclinical studies demonstrate that the antidepressant effects of ketamine are abolished in mice lacking BDNF or possessing a knocked-out TrkB receptor, indicating that TrkB activation is essential for the drug's rapid synaptogenic effects ([DOI: 10.1038/nature10309](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature10309)). Ketamine rapidly dephosphorylates eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2), leading to the disinhibition of BDNF translation and subsequent insertion of GluA1-containing AMPA receptors at the synapse ([DOI: 10.1038/nature10309](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature10309)). While ketamine triggers a robust release of BDNF, some data suggests that its efficacy is contingent upon the pre-existing proteolytic environment; specifically, the rapid synaptic effects require the immediate availability of mBDNF, implying that therapeutic failure in some contexts may stem from deficits in the enzymatic conversion machinery rather than BDNF synthesis per se ([DOI: 10.1016/j.biopsych.2014.11.013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2014.11.013)).

Neuromodulation techniques, including electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), influence BDNF processing by inducing widespread neuronal depolarization and seizure activity, which potently stimulates neurotrophic factor expression. ECT, in particular, is associated with a significant upregulation of peripheral and central BDNF levels, often correlating with clinical response ([DOI: 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2018.11.018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2018.11.018)). Mechanistically, the seizure activity induced by ECT increases the activity of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), an extracellular protease capable of cleaving proBDNF to mBDNF, thereby enhancing TrkB signaling and facilitating synaptic remodeling ([DOI: 10.1001/archpsyc.62.5.530](https://doi.org/10.1001/archpsyc.62.5.530)). Similarly, rTMS applied to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has been observed to modulate serum BDNF levels, though the data presents some controversy regarding whether this modulation represents a direct effect of cortical stimulation or a secondary consequence of clinical improvement ([DOI: 10.1016/j.jad.2017.05.047](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2017.05.047)). Despite variations in magnitude, these somatic treatments converge on the restoration of mBDNF/TrkB tone, highlighting the proteolytic conversion of proBDNF as a common pathway for diverse antidepressant modalities.

## Clinical Implications and Therapeutic Perspectives

The accumulating evidence regarding the neurotrophic hypothesis of affective disorders suggests that the clinical efficacy of current pharmacotherapies is fundamentally limited by their inability to rapidly restore synaptic connectivity in key cortico-limbic circuits ([DOI: 10.1016/j.biopsych.2014.06.007](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2014.06.007)). Consequently, the therapeutic paradigm for treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is shifting toward strategies that selectively modulate specific isoforms of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and their cognate receptors. A critical distinction exists between the precursor protein, proBDNF, and its cleaved mature form, mBDNF; these isoforms exert opposing effects on neuronal structure and function. While mBDNF activation of TrkB promotes synaptogenesis and neuronal survival, proBDNF preferentially binds to the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), often in complex with sortilin, to facilitate long-term depression (LTD) and apoptotic signaling ([DOI: 10.1016/j.neuron.2009.04.021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2009.04.021)). This dichotomy implies that merely elevating total BDNF levels—a mechanism shared by many conventional antidepressants—may be insufficient if the proteolytic conversion to mBDNF is impaired or if p75NTR signaling remains dominant.

Targeting the p75NTR pathway presents a novel avenue for neuropharmacological intervention, particularly for patients who fail to respond to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Preclinical models demonstrate that stress-induced depressive behaviors are associated with increased p75NTR expression and reduced dendritic spine density ([DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1405713111](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1405713111)). Functional blockade of p75NTR using small molecule modulators, such as LM11A-31, has been shown to prevent the pruning of hippocampal dendrites and reverse behavioral despair in rodent models, highlighting the potential of p75NTR antagonism to correct the structural plasticity deficits observed in TRD ([DOI: 10.1038/s41593-019-0362-3](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-019-0362-3)). Furthermore, the therapeutic rapidity of agents like ketamine relies heavily on the acute release of BDNF and the subsequent activation of downstream signaling cascades, such as the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), which rapidly increases synaptic protein synthesis and spine formation in the prefrontal cortex ([DOI: 10.1038/nature10456](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature10456)). This suggests that interventions designed to enhance the local availability of mBDNF or inhibit its retrograde degradation may be critical in sustaining the synaptic remodeling required for antidepressant efficacy.

From a translational perspective, the precise quantification of BDNF isoforms in peripheral biofluids offers significant promise for the development of predictive biomarkers in psychiatry. The measurement of the proBDNF/mBDNF ratio, rather than total BDNF, may provide a more accurate index of disease state and treatment responsiveness, as an elevated ratio has been correlated with symptom severity and poor prognosis in major depressive disorder ([DOI: 10.1177/0269881117728048](https://doi.org/10.1177/0269881117728048)). However, methodological heterogeneity in assay sensitivity remains a substantial barrier to clinical implementation. Future therapeutic trials should prioritize stratification based on these molecular signatures to identify subpopulations most likely to benefit from p75NTR inhibitors or plasticity-enhancing agents, thereby moving the field toward a precision medicine framework for neuropsychiatric disorders ([DOI: 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2019.07.016](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2019.07.016)).
