HIPPOCAMPAL PLASTICITY AFTER ECT:

EPIPHENOMENON OR CORE MECHANISM?

Increased hippocampal gray matter after ECT is robust and

highly replicated across independent MRI studies (15–29) and

meta-/mega-analyses (30–33,35), with larger effect sizes

compared with other brain structures (35). Neuroimaging

studies have also noted changes in hippocampal function

using blood oxygen level–dependent and arterial spin-labeled

fMRI, PET, and SPECT (45,47,63,64), as well as changes in

metabolites with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (18,65,66)

and associated white matter tracts with diffusion MRI (48,67).

These results are consistent with the neurotrophic theory of

depression (59,68), which is supported by evidence of down-

regulated trophic factors (59,68,69) and associated hippo-

campal and cortical atrophy (70) in patients with depression.

Animal models of ECT also report upregulation of a number of

trophic processes, including the creation of new synapses,

neurons, glia, and blood vessels (38–41), and upregulation of

BDNF and other trophic factors (36,37,42). Correspondingly,

human ECT studies also report increased BDNF and other

trophic factors after ECT (36,37), as well as modulation of cy-

tokines (71), both of which are markers of cellular plasticity that

likely correspond with macroanatomical changes noted in MRI

research (72,73). Thus, increased hippocampal gray matter and

other forms of neuroplasticity after ECT are consistent with

current neurotrophic theories of depression and antidepressant

response (52,53), and the robustness and reproducibility of

these ndings constitute a promising advancement in neuro-

psychiatry research. Indeed, ECT-MRI research is in an excel-

lent position to elucidate the role of the hippocampus in the

neurobiology of depression and antidepressant response.

There is well-established, systematic heterogeneity along

the anterior-posterior axis of the hippocampus in connectivity,

function, gene expression, cell subtypes, and other factors,

even within its canonical sub elds (e.g., cornu ammonis,

dentate gyrus, subiculum) (74–80). Correspondingly, the hip-

pocampus is unlikely to be affected uniformly by depressive

neurobiology or by ECT and other antidepressant therapies,

and thus measuring the entire volume of the hippocampus or

its sub elds may be suboptimal, as has been done in previous

studies reporting decreased total hippocampal volume in pa-

tients with depression and increases after ECT and other

treatments. Indeed, some ECT-MRI studies have demon-

strated that plasticity may localize to anterior hippocampus

[e.g., Redlich et al. (17) in Figure 2A] when taking a voxelwise

approach [(17,20,21,26,81,82); see also (24,83) where regional

speci city is more dif cult to assess]. Consistent with these

results, Joshi et al. (15) identi ed subtle, regional changes in

hippocampal shape after ECT in a circumscribed region of

right anterior hippocampus using a novel surface deformation

approach (15). In a follow-up analysis, Leaver et al. (45)

measured voxelwise changes in cerebral blood ow (CBF)

measured with arterial spin-labeled fMRI after ECT and re-

ported increased CBF in right anterior hippocampus near the

same region noted in Joshi et al. (45). Together, these studies

suggest that hippocampal plasticity after ECT may be regionally

speci c, and by extension, the role of the hippocampus in

depressive neurobiology may demonstrate such regional

speci city as well (84).

Statistical approach also matters. ECT and other treatments

are likely to change the brain regardless of antidepressant

response. Therefore, studies that examine effects of ECT a

priori while testing effects of antidepressant response post hoc

are more likely to capture the nonspeci c effects of ECT rather

than precise effects related to the antidepressant response

(35). Correspondingly, studies analyzing the longitudinal ef-

fects of ECT on anterior hippocampus or total hippocampal

volume (i.e., with time or treatment as the independent variable

of interest) have reported inconsistent relationships with anti-

depressant response measured post hoc. Indeed, some of

these studies found that such correlations between symptom

change and change in total hippocampal volume (or, for

example, total dentate gyrus volume) could be more readily

explained by other factors also linked with antidepressant

response to ECT such as age, electrode placement (bitemporal

vs. right unilateral [RUL]), and number of treatments

(25,30,35,43). By contrast, studies targeting antidepressant

response to ECT as the primary independent variable (e.g.,

measuring correlations between symptom change and pre-

treatment neurobiology or posttreatment-course plasticity)

were much more likely to identify brain regions previously

linked to neurobiological models of depression (52,53) such as

anterior cingulate (17,50,85), left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex

(49), and other corticolimbic regions (17,43,49,85–91).

Taken together, these studies suggest that the role of the

hippocampus in antidepressant response may be best studied

with direct a priori examination of antidepressant response,

and when measuring regional change within the hippocampus

and its sub elds (i.e., rather than total volume). For example,

recent preliminary evidence from our group suggests the

location of hippocampal plasticity differs when responders and

nonresponders to ECT were analyzed separately (45,47)

(Figure 2B). Nonresponders (i.e., ,50% improvement in

depression scores) showed increased CBF in bilateral anterior

hippocampus overlapping the amygdala (45,47) and wide-

spread bilateral increased hippocampal gray matter volume

(47). By contrast, responders (.50% improvement) showed

increased CBF in right mid and left posterior hippocampus and

increased gray matter volume isolated to right amygdala and

anterior hippocampus (47). These locations of regional CBF

change associated with different functional networks

measured with resting-state blood oxygen level–dependent

fMRI, one of which was preferentially modulated during and

after ECT in responders, connecting the thalamus and basal

ganglia with midanterior hippocampus (47). In diffusion MRI,

microstructural markers in hippocampal tracts originating in

right midanterior hippocampus also correlated with antide-

pressant response to ECT (48). These results corroborate re-

ports from other groups that connectivity within subregional

hippocampal circuits correlate with antidepressant response to

ECT (46,92).

In sum, some aspects of hippocampal plasticity after ECT

(e.g., total volume change) may be epiphenoma re ecting

the nonspeci c effects of the treatment itself. However, core

antidepressant mechanisms of ECT may involve neuroplastic

change within speci c subregions of the hippocampus and

corresponding extrinsic connections, which vary along the

length of the structure. In other words, hippocampal plas-

ticity in antidepressant response (and hippocampal

dysfunction/atrophy in the neurobiology of depression) is

unlikely to affect the hippocampus uniformly and is unlikely

to occur in isolation from the other brain regions and net-

works. Given the robustness and replicability of total hip-

pocampal volume (and total sub eld volume) changes after

ECT (15–35), future independent studies that measure

regional changes within the hippocampus and MTL [e.g.,

using standard voxelwise or shape-deformation methods,

ultrahigh resolution MRI, and/or rodent and nonhuman pri-

mate research (93)], concurrent with changes occurring

elsewhere within hippocampal/corticolimbic circuits, and

while examining antidepressant response directly (i.e., rather

than pre- vs. posttreatment effects) are in an excellent po-

sition to elucidate the role of the hippocampus in the

neurobiology of depression.

The hippocampus and MTL are also involved in memory for

past events and other information, as well as other cognitive

processes such as spatial navigation, planning, and sequence

processing (94). ECT is associated with transient cognitive

dif culties during treatment, and in some cases, episodic

memory complaints persist after treatment course, particularly

after bitemporal treatment (5–7). To our knowledge, robust,

consistent relationships between hippocampal change and

cognitive side effects have not been identi ed in ECT

(47,95,96), perhaps because relatively few such studies exist

and cognitive measures vary across studies. The great majority

of patients in these naturalistic studies also receive RUL ECT,

which confers lower risk of cognitive side effects. However, it is

worth noting that the same issues that complicate studying

antidepressant outcomes (as described above) may also apply

when assessing the neurobiology of cognitive outcomes.

Studies that target correlations between cognitive/memory

changes after ECT and granular, regional changes within hip-

pocampus/MTL and associated networks are needed.
