## Executive Summary

Contemporary psychiatric neuroscience conceptualizes major depressive disorder (MDD) as a pathology of impaired neuroplasticity and large-scale network dysfunction, characterized within the "connectomic glutamate framework" by the erosion of synaptic connectivity and glial support which destabilizes the Default Mode, Salience, and Executive networks ([DOI: 10.3390/brainsci16010018](https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci16010018)). Both neuromodulatory interventions, such as high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), and pharmacotherapies, including rapid-acting agents like ketamine and traditional antidepressants, exert their therapeutic effects through the induction of structural plasticity, evidenced by increased dendritic spine density and synaptogenesis in prefrontal and hippocampal circuits ([DOI: 10.3389/fncel.2022.1082211](https://doi.org/10.3389/fncel.2022.1082211), [DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-24933-8](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-24933-8)). However, the clinical translation of these biological changes remains challenging, as reviews of resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) alterations following treatments like escitalopram demonstrate complex, heterogeneous dynamics within intrinsic networks that have yet to yield a single validated biomarker across independent datasets ([DOI: 10.1002/hbm.26231](https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.26231), [DOI: 10.3389/fpsyt.2021.565136](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.565136)).

The theoretical elucidation of structure-function coupling reveals that while the physical scaffold of white matter tracts and gray matter volume constrains functional connectivity, the temporal dynamics of neuropsychiatric recovery are non-linear and bidirectional rather than strictly hierarchical ([DOI: 10.1177/1352458520971807](https://doi.org/10.1177/1352458520971807), [DOI: 10.64898/2025.12.04.692468](https://doi.org/10.64898/2025.12.04.692468)). Evidence from longitudinal studies suggests that alterations in functional connectivity often precede macroscopic structural remodeling, implying that functional reorganization may be a prerequisite for or a driver of subsequent structural plasticity, contingent upon the stage of pathology and the intensity of the stimulus ([DOI: 10.12688/WELLCOMEOPENRES.14572.1](https://doi.org/10.12688/WELLCOMEOPENRES.14572.1), [DOI: 10.3390/life15091342](https://doi.org/10.3390/life15091342)). To disentangle these complex interactions, advanced methodological approaches utilizing data-driven fusion techniques, such as joint independent component analysis (ICA) and parallel multilink group ICA, have become essential for identifying covarying structural and functional networks and establishing the causal sequences of brain reorganization in response to therapeutic interventions ([DOI: 10.1002/hbm.26155](https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.26155), [DOI: 10.1002/hbm.26456](https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.26456), [DOI: 10.1007/s11682-025-01049-y](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11682-025-01049-y)).

## Mechanisms of Structural Plasticity Induced by Neuromodulation and Pharmacotherapy

Current conceptual frameworks increasingly characterize major depressive disorder (MDD) not merely as a monoaminergic deficiency, but as a disorder of impaired neuroplasticity and large-scale network dysfunction ([DOI: 10.3390/brainsci16010018](https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci16010018)). Within this "connectomic glutamate framework," chronic stress and depression are understood to erode synaptic connectivity and reduce glial support, destabilizing interactions between the default mode, salience, and executive networks ([DOI: 10.3390/brainsci16010018](https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci16010018)). Conventional antidepressants and novel neuromodulation techniques appear to exert their therapeutic effects, at least partially, through the restoration of these structural deficits via distinct yet overlapping neurobiological pathways.

The rapid-acting glutamatergic agent ketamine has fundamentally altered the understanding of antidepressant mechanisms by demonstrating that NMDAR blockade and subsequent AMPAR facilitation can activate mTORC1 and BDNF signaling pathways, thereby driving synaptogenesis and dendritic spine formation ([DOI: 10.3390/brainsci16010018](https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci16010018)). Behavioral improvements following ketamine administration manifest rapidly, often within 24 hours and persisting up to a week, well beyond the drug's plasma half-life ([DOI: 10.1051/jbio/2023026](https://doi.org/10.1051/jbio/2023026)). This temporal dissociation between pharmacokinetics and clinical effect suggests that sustained neuroplastic changes underpin the symptom remission. Indeed, the glutamatergic pyramidal cells of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) are heavily implicated in these structural remodeling processes ([DOI: 10.1051/jbio/2023026](https://doi.org/10.1051/jbio/2023026)). However, longitudinal two-photon imaging studies provide granular insight into the temporal evolution of these anatomical changes; while behavioral effects are acute, subchronic administration of low-dose ketamine was found to significantly enhance dendritic spine formation rates in the somatosensory cortex only at a delayed interval of 72 to 132 hours post-initial administration, rather than in the immediate 6 to 24 hour window ([DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-24933-8](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-24933-8)). This observation indicates that the structural consolidation of synaptogenesis may follow the initial molecular signaling cascade, preventing the synaptic pruning typically observed in control subjects ([DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-24933-8](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-24933-8)).

In contrast to the rapid synaptic spinogenesis induced by glutamatergic agents, conventional pharmacotherapies such as the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine operate on a more protracted timescale, consistent with the delayed clinical onset typical of monoaminergic drugs. In genetic animal models of depression, imipramine treatment has been shown to increase the absolute number of hippocampal synapses and neurons ([DOI: 10.1002/hipo.20718](https://doi.org/10.1002/hipo.20718)). The mechanisms underlying these structural changes are intimately linked to serotonergic regulation of the cytoskeleton. Specifically, serotonin acts as a regulator of synaptogenesis, influencing the expression of tyrosinated α-tubulin, a microtubular protein essential for structural adaptation ([DOI: 10.2174/1874205X01004010005](https://doi.org/10.2174/1874205X01004010005)). This link between central 5-HT activity and cytoskeletal dynamics highlights how monoaminergic agents may facilitate structural remodeling over weeks of treatment, restoring the neuronal plasticity that is modified in depressive states ([DOI: 10.2174/1874205X01004010005](https://doi.org/10.2174/1874205X01004010005)).

Neuromodulation techniques induce structural plasticity through physical rather than pharmacological means, often with unique regional and laminar specificities. High-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (HF-rTMS) applied over the prefrontal cortex, for instance, has been demonstrated to exert antidepressant-like effects by modulating morphological plasticity specifically in layers II/III and V of the mPFC ([DOI: 10.3389/fncel.2022.1082211](https://doi.org/10.3389/fncel.2022.1082211)). Following a short 5-day course of HF-rTMS, preclinical models exhibit increased spine density in both apical and basal dendrites of these layers, alongside increased dendritic complexity as measured by Sholl analysis ([DOI: 10.3389/fncel.2022.1082211](https://doi.org/10.3389/fncel.2022.1082211)). These findings suggest that rTMS can rapidly reverse the atrophy of specific cortical layers implicated in emotional regulation.

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), the most efficacious antidepressant treatment available, produces the most robust macroscopic anatomical changes, particularly within the hippocampus. Structural MRI studies have consistently reported increases in hippocampal volume following ECT, including specific increases in the dentate gyrus, the niche where adult neurogenesis occurs ([DOI: 10.1177/15500594211044066](https://doi.org/10.1177/15500594211044066)). These volumetric expansions are supported by preclinical evidence indicating that ECT induces a multifaceted neuroplastic response involving neurogenesis, gliogenesis, synaptogenesis, and angiogenesis ([DOI: 10.1177/15500594211044066](https://doi.org/10.1177/15500594211044066)). Despite the robustness of these anatomical findings, the clinical relevance of these volume changes continues to be debated, as the correlation between hippocampal enlargement and symptom remission remains complex ([DOI: 10.1177/15500594211044066](https://doi.org/10.1177/15500594211044066)).

The glial and immune components of the neural environment play a critical, though often underappreciated, role in the structural plasticity induced by both pharmacological and neuromodulatory interventions. The concept of the "quad-partite synapse" emphasizes the role of astrocytes and microglia in shaping synaptic connectivity ([DOI: 10.3390/brainsci16010018](https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci16010018)). Neuroinflammatory processes and microglial activity are now recognized as modulators of neuroplasticity, capable of influencing disease progression in psychiatric conditions ([DOI: 10.3389/fncel.2014.00419](https://doi.org/10.3389/fncel.2014.00419)). Consequently, successful therapeutic interventions may ultimately rely on their ability to modulate this neuroimmune-neuroplasticity interface, restoring glial support and dampening maladaptive immune signaling that contributes to synaptic erosion in MDD ([DOI: 10.3390/brainsci16010018;](https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci16010018;) [DOI: 10.3389/fncel.2014.00419](https://doi.org/10.3389/fncel.2014.00419)).

## Resting-State Functional Connectivity Alterations in Response to Treatment

The investigation of resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) alterations following therapeutic interventions has revealed complex dynamics within large-scale intrinsic brain networks, particularly the Default Mode Network (DMN), Central Executive Network (CEN), and Salience Network. Despite the promise of RSFC as a biomarker for treatment response, a comprehensive review of mood disorders indicates that no single biomarker has been validated across independent datasets or distinct analytical modalities, highlighting the heterogeneity of network reorganization across pathologies ([DOI: 10.3389/fpsyt.2021.565136](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.565136)). This heterogeneity underscores the necessity of distinguishing between acute pharmacologically induced network reorganization and the long-term functional stabilization associated with clinical remission or neuroplastic adaptation.

In the context of major depressive disorder (MDD), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) appear to facilitate a normalization of aberrant connectivity between subcortical and attentional systems. Specifically, a 12-week longitudinal study demonstrated that decreased subcortical network (SCN) to ventral attention network (VAN) connectivity observed at baseline in MDD patients significantly increased post-treatment, reaching levels comparable to healthy controls ([DOI: 10.1002/hbm.26231](https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.26231)). This suggests that successful pharmacological response involves the restoration of communication between subcortical structures and attentional networks. Conversely, predictive modeling suggests that treatment outcomes may be moderated by baseline connectivity patterns rather than solely by post-treatment changes. In the EMBARC study, baseline intrinsic connectivity patterns within emotion processing and executive function networks moderated the differential response to sertraline versus placebo over an 8-week period, implying that pre-existing neural architecture determines the capacity for acute network reorganization ([DOI: 10.1176/appi.ajp.2019.18070870](https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ajp.2019.18070870)).

Further complicating the traditional cortico-limbic model of depression, research into electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has highlighted the predictive utility of networks outside the canonical DMN-CEN axis. While connectivity between dorsal prefrontal cortices and limbic regions predicts ECT response, the inclusion of visual network connectivity measures substantially enhanced the predictive accuracy for remission, suggesting that therapeutic response involves a broader network integration than previously appreciated ([DOI: 10.1038/s41598-019-41175-4](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-41175-4)). In first-episode psychosis, prospective longitudinal designs have identified baseline connectivity aberrations in the hippocampus, bilateral insula, and temporal poles as predictors of subsequent treatment resistance to antipsychotics ([DOI: 10.1093/braincomms/fcae094](https://doi.org/10.1093/braincomms/fcae094)). This indicates that the failure to achieve long-term functional stabilization may be rooted in early, intrinsic dysfunction of limbic-insular networks that precede and potentially limit the efficacy of pharmacological intervention.

Beyond pharmacotherapy, long-term functional stabilization is evident in the neuroplastic reorganization following motor rehabilitation in chronic stroke. Following motor imagery training, patients exhibited significant increases in inter-hemispheric functional connectivity and reductions in intra-hemispheric connectivity relative to conventional therapy ([DOI: 10.1109/TNSRE.2019.2940980](https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2019.2940980)). Graph-theoretical analysis linked these changes to improved motor function, illustrating a shift toward a more distributed and balanced network topology that supports recovery. Interpreting these alterations requires rigorous consideration of measurement reliability; studies utilizing ultrahigh-field 7-Tesla MRI have confirmed that while core resting-state networks demonstrate test-retest stability, the assessment of acute changes demands precise methodology to distinguish true biological reorganization from signal variance ([DOI: 10.1002/hbm.25771](https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.25771)). Furthermore, the identification of these networks benefits from large-scale multi-model approaches, such as those derived from datasets exceeding 100,000 participants, which provide canonical intrinsic connectivity network templates necessary for robust clinical inference ([DOI: 10.1002/hbm.26472](https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.26472)).

## Theoretical Frameworks of Structure-Function Coupling in Neuropsychiatric Recovery

The elucidation of structure-function coupling represents a critical frontier in understanding the neurobiological substrates of neuropsychiatric recovery, necessitating a move beyond static anatomical mapping to dynamic models of network interaction. As the field seeks to establish a foundational theory of brain connectivity, it is essential to integrate diverse methodological approaches to explain how the physical scaffold of white matter tracts and gray matter volume constrains or permits the functional synchrony required for cognitive restoration ([DOI: 10.1007/s12021-023-09641-7](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12021-023-09641-7)). The prevailing theoretical framework posits a spectrum of anatomical constraint, where the degree to which functional connectivity (FC) is bound to structural connectivity (SC) varies across cortical hierarchies and physiological states. Research in the mouse cortex has established that this coupling adheres to a unimodal-to-transmodal gradient, indicating that primary sensory areas operate under tight anatomical constraint, while transmodal association areas exhibit greater flexibility ([DOI: 10.64898/2025.12.04.692468](https://doi.org/10.64898/2025.12.04.692468)). This gradient is theoretically pivotal for recovery; the looser coupling in higher-order regions may provide the necessary redundancy for functional reorganization following injury, whereas the rigid coupling in primary areas explains the persistence of deficits such as those observed in aphasia, where recovery often relies on the recruitment of alternative, non-canonical pathways ([DOI: 10.1002/ana.25217](https://doi.org/10.1002/ana.25217)).

Advancing beyond node-centric analyses, novel edge-centric models utilizing spectral graph theory have reformulated structure-function relationships as constrained flow problems. By modeling structural connections as conductances and functional relationships as nodal constraints via Modified Nodal Analysis (MNA), these frameworks allow for the precise quantification of how specific structural pathways facilitate or inhibit neural dynamics ([DOI: 10.1101/2024.03.03.583186](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.03.03.583186)). This granularity is vital for understanding recovery, as it suggests that restoring specific "flows" of information may be more relevant than global network metrics. Empirical evidence supporting the dynamic nature of this coupling comes from investigations of consciousness transitions. During dexmedetomidine-induced hypnosis, the brain exhibits increased structure-function coupling, implying that unconscious states are characterized by functional dynamics that are excessively constrained by the underlying anatomical substrate ([DOI: 10.1038/s42003-025-08577-9](https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-025-08577-9)). Conversely, the recovery of consciousness is marked by a disentanglement of function from structure, particularly in the cerebellum, suggesting that successful neuropsychiatric recovery requires a re-establishment of functional independence from direct anatomical links ([DOI: 10.1038/s42003-025-08577-9](https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-025-08577-9)).

In pathological contexts such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), the integrity of structure-function coupling serves as both a biomarker of impairment and a potential target for therapeutic intervention. In the early stages of MS, structural remodeling characterized by increased clustering and decreased path length drives cognitive impairment through altered structure-function relationships, suggesting that a failure to maintain optimal coupling underlies cognitive decline ([DOI: 10.1177/1352458520971807](https://doi.org/10.1177/1352458520971807)). Similarly, in AD, the integration of structural MRI and resting-state fMRI through correlation-consistent learning reveals that enforcing alignment between anatomical substrates and functional synchrony improves diagnostic classification ([DOI: 10.1109/EMBC58623.2025.11253645](https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC58623.2025.11253645)). This implies that the breakdown of coherent structure-function relationships is a hallmark of neurodegeneration. However, the capacity for recovery is not uniform across all neural systems; while canonical neurogenic niches like the hippocampus are responsive to trophic support, non-canonical areas such as the hypothalamus present unique challenges for structural repair and functional integration ([DOI: 10.3390/ijms262210914](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms262210914)). Ultimately, the evidence suggests that neuropsychiatric recovery is not merely a return to a pre-morbid state, but a dynamic re-balancing of the tension between rigid anatomical constraint and flexible functional autonomy.

## Temporal Dynamics and Causality: Sequencing of Structural and Functional Changes

The elucidation of temporal dynamics regarding structural and functional brain plasticity presents a complex challenge, as evidence suggests a non-linear interaction where functional connectivity (FC) alterations often precede structural remodeling, yet the directionality and magnitude of these effects are highly contingent upon the stage of pathology, the specific neural networks involved, and the intensity of the external stimulus. High-resolution longitudinal data indicates that macroscopic functional connectivity changes frequently serve as the primary driver in the early phases of neural adaptation or disease propagation. In a detailed single-case longitudinal study spanning 19 weeks, changes in functional connectivity within the default-mode, fronto-parietal, and sensory-related networks were observed to occur significantly in advance of corresponding structural connectivity alterations, with the most pronounced temporal lags identified in sensory-related networks ([DOI: 10.12688/WELLCOMEOPENRES.14572.1](https://doi.org/10.12688/WELLCOMEOPENRES.14572.1)). This precedence of functional over structural adaptation is further corroborated by computational models of pathological progression in Alzheimer's disease, which demonstrate that while large-scale network architecture constrains tau spread, the relative dominance of connectome modes shifts over time; specifically, FC predominantly drives propagation in early stages and in subcortical, insular, and frontal regions, whereas structural connectivity (SC) assumes a primary role in later stages and occipital or limbic regions ([DOI: 10.48550/arXiv.2510.20148](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2510.20148)).

The sequencing of these changes is not uniform across all cognitive domains or anatomical regions, highlighting significant stage-dependent and region-specific heterogeneity. Research on multilingual neurodevelopment in children reveals a dissociation within the frontal-striatal system, where the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex/pre-supplement motor area exhibited functional adaptation to multilingual competence without corresponding structural changes, while the left caudate displayed structural specialization, suggesting that functional shifts can occur independently or prior to structural consolidation in specific nodes ([DOI: 10.3390/brainsci15010054](https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci15010054)). Similarly, longitudinal studies of physical training suggest that the level of expertise dictates the modality of plasticity; high-level endurance runners exhibited functional changes, such as increased degree centrality in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, whereas moderate-level runners displayed more widespread structural remodeling, including increased gray matter volume in prefrontal and insular regions ([DOI: 10.3390/life15091342](https://doi.org/10.3390/life15091342)). This implies that while functional reorganization may be an initial response to sustained demand, structural consolidation—likely representing a more permanent trace of adaptation—may emerge subsequently or in parallel depending on the training intensity and duration.

However, establishing strict temporal causality is complicated by methodological limitations inherent in many longitudinal designs, particularly those with sparse sampling intervals. While cross-sectional multimodal studies, such as those investigating elite shooters, identify concurrent increases in regional homogeneity, functional connectivity, and cortical thickness ([DOI: 10.3389/fnhum.2025.1530642](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2025.1530642)), they lack the temporal resolution to confirm whether these structural changes are a consequence of functional activity or a prerequisite for high-level performance. Furthermore, interventions utilizing transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (TUS) indicate that neuromodulation can simultaneously impact brain morphology, neurochemistry, and neural dynamics, suggesting that in therapeutic contexts, functional and structural changes may evolve through tightly coupled, parallel pathways rather than strictly sequential ones ([DOI: 10.1101/2025.03.10.642483](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.03.10.642483)). The role of structural covariance also remains a critical predictive factor; for instance, early structural covariance patterns in the salience network have been shown to predict longitudinal gains in arithmetic ability in children, supporting the hypothesis that the structural scaffold can constrain or facilitate future functional competence ([DOI: 10.1159/000531419](https://doi.org/10.1159/000531419)). This interplay is also observed in pathological aging, where longitudinal declines in anterior medial temporal lobe functional connectivity correlate with perfusion changes and memory decline, independent of structural metrics ([DOI: 10.1093/cercor/bhw233](https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhw233)).

Disruptions in the typical temporal sequencing of structure-function coupling are increasingly recognized as biomarkers for neuropsychiatric disorders. In stroke recovery, the normalization of resting-state functional connectivity in the default mode and sensorimotor networks occurs over a protracted period (up to 12 months), yet the degree to which these functional recoveries are dependent on white matter structural repair versus functional reorganization remains unclear ([DOI: 10.1089/brain.2022.0017](https://doi.org/10.1089/brain.2022.0017)). In neurodevelopmental conditions such as ADHD, longitudinal studies reveal aberrant trajectories in both functional connectivity (reduced degree and local efficiency) and structure-function coupling, suggesting a failure of the typical maturational processes where functional networks normally become refined by underlying structural architecture ([DOI: 10.1002/hbm.26288](https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.26288)) ([DOI: 10.1038/s41398-023-02546-8](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-023-02546-8)). Ultimately, the weight of evidence points toward a model where functional dynamics provide the immediate, flexible substrate for early behavioral adaptation and disease spread, which subsequently guides structural remodeling; however, this relationship is moderated by regional vulnerabilities and the chronicity of the stimulus, necessitating sophisticated dynamic network indices to accurately capture these temporal evolutions ([DOI: 10.3390/bioengineering12111218](https://doi.org/10.3390/bioengineering12111218)).

## Methodological Approaches to Multimodal Integration

The methodological landscape for integrating structural plasticity metrics with functional connectivity dynamics is increasingly dominated by data-driven fusion techniques designed to exploit the complementary nature of multimodal neuroimaging data. Independent component analysis (ICA) and its variants serve as a primary framework for decomposing complex imaging data into statistically independent sources, facilitating the identification of covarying structural and functional networks. While linear joint ICA (jICA) has been widely utilized to fuse gray matter concentrations with functional network connectivity, recent advancements suggest that non-linear formulations may offer superior performance in detecting abnormal neural patterns, particularly in complex neuropsychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia, by allowing for non-linearly mixed sources ([DOI: 10.1109/ivmsp54334.2022.9816248](https://doi.org/10.1109/ivmsp54334.2022.9816248)). This evolution reflects a broader effort to refine the sensitivity of multimodal fusion to subtle neuropathological changes that may predict or reflect treatment response.

A significant methodological limitation of standard jICA is the assumption of a single shared mixing matrix linking modalities, which can obscure distinct relationships between structural features and specific functional networks. To address this, researchers have developed parallel multilink joint ICA (pml-jICA) and related frameworks that relax the constraint of a strictly shared mixing matrix, permitting a more balanced weight distribution and allowing structural data to couple with multiple functional intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) simultaneously ([DOI: 10.1002/hbm.26456](https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.26456)). This approach has demonstrated enhanced capacity to identify significant structure-function coupling in Alzheimer’s disease, yielding large effect sizes in regions such as the default mode network compared to traditional methods ([DOI: 10.1002/hbm.26456](https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.26456)). The extension of this framework to parallel multilink group jICA (pmg-jICA) enables the fusion of 3D structural maps with 4D functional data, thereby preserving the temporal dimension of fMRI to link specific spatial components to dynamic functional fluctuations across multiple resting-state networks ([DOI: 10.1101/2024.03.21.586091](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.03.21.586091)). These multilink approaches have proven effective in identifying joint independent sources of altered activation patterns in key regions, providing a more granular view of pathology than single-modality analyses ([DOI: 10.1109/EMBC53108.2024.10782528](https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC53108.2024.10782528)).

Beyond standard voxel-based or network-based fusion, joint connectivity matrix ICA (cmICA) provides a distinct analytical vector by automating the linking of structural and functional connectivity matrices derived from diffusion-weighted imaging and functional MRI, respectively. This data-driven parcellation technique reveals that while structural and functional connectivities are complementary, they often converge on common cortical segregation patterns, offering insights into the mechanistic relationship between anatomical constraints and functional activity ([DOI: 10.1002/hbm.26155](https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.26155)). The dynamic integration of these matrices is further advanced by approaches that seek to capture the temporal variability of connectivity, thereby linking structural plasticity to the transient states of functional networks ([DOI: 10.1101/2025.05.15.653851](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.05.15.653851)). Furthermore, iterative joint learning procedures that incorporate both structural and functional connectivity information have been shown to produce more spatially distinct ICNs and greater sensitivity to group differences, such as those observed in schizophrenia, by optimizing the networks during the estimation process ([DOI: 10.1109/MLSP55844.2023.10285932](https://doi.org/10.1109/MLSP55844.2023.10285932)).

The integration of temporal and spectral dimensions is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of brain dynamics, particularly when assessing clinical progression or treatment outcomes. Traditional fusion methods often reduce fMRI data to 3D spatial maps, potentially discarding critical temporal information. The three-way parallel group ICA (pGICA) method addresses this by incorporating first-level 4D fMRI data into a unified optimization framework, utilizing a variability matrix to capture subject-wise functional dynamics and link them to structural features ([DOI: 10.1002/hbm.25720](https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.25720)). Additionally, the incorporation of frequency-specific analysis, such as filter-banked connectivity (FBC), allows for the dissection of multimodal covariation across distinct frequency bands. This is particularly relevant given that pathological states, including schizophrenia, involve alterations in specific frequency ranges of connectivity; linking these frequency-specific cortico-subcortical connectivity changes to gray matter structure via multimodal fusion provides a more nuanced characterization of the disorder ([DOI: 10.1007/s12021-025-09728-3](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12021-025-09728-3)).

Hybrid approaches that combine ICA with other multivariate techniques, such as canonical correlation analysis (CCA), offer robust solutions for longitudinal and developmental studies where treatment response is a moving target. For instance, the symmetric fusion of multiset CCA and jICA has been employed to uncover linked longitudinal change patterns in functional network connectivity and gray matter volume within adolescent cohorts ([DOI: 10.1109/BHI58575.2023.10313489](https://doi.org/10.1109/BHI58575.2023.10313489)). Similarly, in the context of substance use disorders, the combination of graph-theoretical measures derived from multi-shell diffusion imaging with resting-state fMRI, analyzed via mCCA plus joint ICA, has elucidated complex network-level pathology that would be obscured by unimodal analysis ([DOI: 10.1101/2023.02.20.23285655](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.02.20.23285655)). While the majority of these methodologies focus on cross-sectional or developmental trajectories, the principles of multimodal fusion are increasingly being applied to precision medicine. Novel frameworks utilizing sensor-oriented multimodal collaborative modeling, often grounded in deep learning architectures, demonstrate the potential for integrating imaging data with clinical variables to jointly model disease grading and treatment response, moving beyond independent analysis toward a holistic view of patient status ([DOI: 10.3390/s26020737](https://doi.org/10.3390/s26020737)). These methodological innovations underscore the critical importance of selecting fusion techniques that respect the statistical and anatomical properties of both structural and functional data to accurately characterize the neural correlates of therapeutic intervention.
