## Executive Summary

The therapeutic mechanisms underlying contemporary psychiatric interventions, including electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), psychedelics, antidepressants, and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), are increasingly conceptualized through the distinct yet interconnected phenomena of structural plasticity and resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) changes. Structural plasticity entails the physical remodeling of neural architecture, manifesting as dendritic arborization, spinogenesis, and alterations in gray matter volume, whereas rs-FC represents the dynamic synchronization of intrinsic neural networks. Current evidence suggests these are not independent processes; rather, a complex interplay exists wherein rapid functional network reorganization often precedes and potentially facilitates the slower consolidation of anatomical changes.

Chronobiological analysis of these neuromodulatory and pharmacotherapeutic interventions reveals a consistent temporal dissociation between acute functional shifts and delayed structural remodeling. Rapid-acting agents such as psychedelics and neuromodulatory techniques like rTMS frequently induce clinical improvement and alterations in functional connectivity within hours or days, a timeline that significantly outpaces the weeks typically required for macroscopic structural plasticity. This observation supports a hierarchical model of neuroplasticity in which the early normalization of rs-FC, particularly the reduction of pathological hyperconnectivity within the default mode network (DMN), acts as a primary driver for the subsequent molecular cascades necessary for structural growth.

Consequently, the prevailing theoretical framework posits that structural and functional changes represent sequential stages of a unified recovery process rather than parallel independent pathways. Activity-dependent plasticity mechanisms suggest that the initial reconfiguration of functional networks establishes the necessary neurobiological milieu to drive structural synaptogenesis and volume increases. In this context, early rs-FC modulation is not merely an epiphenomenon but a critical antecedent that dictates the trajectory and efficacy of long-term structural remodeling, ultimately sustaining the therapeutic response across diverse treatment modalities.

## Structural and Functional Plasticity in Neuromodulation and Pharmacotherapy

The therapeutic mechanisms underlying contemporary psychiatric interventions are increasingly conceptualized through the lens of neuroplasticity, necessitating a distinction between structural modifications and alterations in resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC). Structural plasticity refers to the physical remodeling of neural architecture, encompassing processes such as dendritic arborization, spinogenesis, synaptogenesis, and macroscopic changes in gray matter volume. In contrast, rs-FC provides a index of functional network integration by measuring the temporal correlation of blood-oxygen-level-dependent signals between spatially distinct brain regions at rest, reflecting the intrinsic functional architecture of the brain.

Pharmacological interventions, particularly conventional antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), engage these plasticity mechanisms over a protracted timeline that mirrors their delayed clinical onset. Chronic administration of antidepressants is associated with the upregulation of neurotrophic factors, most notably brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which facilitates hippocampal neurogenesis and synaptic remodeling. These structural adaptations are paralleled by functional changes, where pharmacotherapy appears to modulate connectivity within the default mode network (DMN) and salience network, potentially attenuating the pathological hyperconnectivity often observed in major depressive disorder. However, the magnitude of structural change induced by standard pharmacotherapy is generally modest compared to more invasive interventions.

In the realm of rapid-acting therapeutics, psychedelics present a unique profile of plasticity. Preclinical and translational evidence suggests that agents like psilocybin and ketamine can rapidly stimulate dendritic growth and increase spine density in cortical neurons, occurring on a timescale that aligns with their immediate antidepressant effects. Functionally, psychedelics induce an acute, profound disintegration of established network hierarchies, characterized by a marked reduction in the functional integrity of the DMN and a concomitant increase in global connectivity and entropy. This state of heightened functional flexibility is hypothesized to disrupt maladaptive cognitive patterns, allowing for the reconsolidation of neural circuits into healthier configurations following the acute drug experience.

Neuromodulation techniques such as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) demonstrate distinct yet overlapping effects on brain plasticity. ECT represents the most potent intervention for eliciting structural changes, with longitudinal neuroimaging consistently demonstrating significant increases in hippocampal and amygdala gray matter volume following a course of treatment. These volumetric expansions are thought to result from neurotrophic cascades, anti-inflammatory effects, and potentially angiogenesis. Regarding functional connectivity, ECT is associated with a widespread reduction in functional connectivity, particularly within the DMN, alongside enhanced connectivity between cognitive control regions and limbic areas. In contrast, rTMS exerts more focal effects, with the primary therapeutic mechanism posited to be the modulation of rs-FC rather than gross structural remodeling. While some studies report gray matter increases in the prefrontal cortex following rTMS, the evidence is less robust than for ECT. Instead, rTMS appears to normalize dysregulated connectivity within the depression network, specifically by targeting the functional connectivity between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the subgenual cingulate, thereby restoring top-down control over limbic hyperactivity.

## Temporal Dynamics: Acute Network Reorganization versus Delayed Structural Remodeling

The chronobiology of therapeutic interventions in neuropsychiatry reveals a distinct temporal dissociation between rapid functional network reorganization and the more gradual process of structural neuroplasticity. In the context of rapid-acting agents such as psychedelics and neuromodulatory techniques like repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), clinical improvements and biomarker changes often manifest within hours or days, whereas macroscopic structural remodeling typically requires weeks to months. This temporal discrepancy suggests that the initial therapeutic efficacy of these interventions is driven primarily by dynamic shifts in functional connectivity rather than immediate structural alterations.

Acute administration of serotonergic psychedelics precipitates an immediate and profound shift in functional brain network dynamics, characterized by a reduction in the functional integrity and modularity of the Default Mode Network (DMN) alongside a global increase in the entropy of brain activity. This phenomenon, often described as a "network disintegration," disrupts rigid patterns of functional connectivity and is associated with the acute subjective effects of these compounds. The rapidity of these changes—occurring within minutes of administration—highlights a capacity for immediate neuromodulation that precedes any measurable structural change. Similarly, rTMS exerts immediate effects on cortical excitability and functional connectivity, particularly within the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and its connections to limbic structures. These acute functional modulations, often observable after a single session, are thought to normalize pathological hypo- or hyper-connectivity in disorders such as major depressive disorder, providing a mechanistic basis for early symptomatic improvement.

In contradistinction to these rapid functional dynamics, the structural substrates of sustained therapeutic response adhere to a significantly protracted timeline mediated by neurotrophic factors. The upregulation of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and subsequent activation of tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) initiates intracellular cascades that promote synaptogenesis and dendritic spine remodeling. While the molecular signaling cascades may be triggered acutely, the physical consolidation of new synaptic connections and the increase in dendritic spine density are processes that inherently require time for protein synthesis and cytoskeletal reorganization. Consequently, observable microstructural changes, such as alterations in dendritic arborization, typically peak days to weeks following the initial intervention. At the macroscopic level, changes in gray matter volume or cortical thickness detectable via neuroimaging generally require sustained treatment over several weeks to months, aligning with the delayed onset of full therapeutic remission in chronic psychiatric conditions.

The current evidence supports a model of temporal precedence wherein acute network reorganization serves as the primary driver of early clinical effects and potentially establishes the neurobiological environment necessary for subsequent structural consolidation. The immediate entropy increase or connectivity modulation induced by psychedelics or rTMS does not represent a final state but rather a transitional phase that facilitates a "critical period" of heightened plasticity. It is within this window of altered functional dynamics that the slower, protein synthesis-dependent structural remodeling is permitted to occur, ultimately solidifying the therapeutic gains. Thus, while functional connectivity changes constitute the initial mechanistic response, it is the delayed structural neuroplasticity that likely underpins the long-term durability of the therapeutic effect.

## Mechanistic Interplay: Activity-Dependent Plasticity and Structure-Function Coupling

The investigation into the causal relationships between neural activity and anatomical change centers on a fundamental dichotomy in contemporary neuroscience: whether altered functional connectivity drives the molecular cascades necessary for structural growth—a process conceptualized as activity-dependent plasticity—or if the pre-existing anatomical scaffold acts as a necessary constraint, serving as a prerequisite for the stable reconfiguration of functional networks. Resolving this directionality requires a synthesis of multimodal imaging and molecular evidence, yet current literature presents a complex, often contradictory, picture of structure-function coupling. Proponents of the functional primacy hypothesis argue that synchronous neuronal firing patterns initiate intracellular signaling pathways that upregulate immediate early genes, such as *c-Fos* and *Arc*, which subsequently mediate cytoskeletal rearrangements and synaptic strengthening. This perspective suggests that the temporal correlation of blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals precedes and predicts microstructural alterations, implying that functional connectivity (FC) dictates the trajectory of structural remodeling. Longitudinal studies utilizing diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) alongside resting-state functional MRI have provided evidence supporting this sequence, demonstrating that changes in FC metrics can forecast subsequent variations in white matter integrity, particularly during learning or rehabilitation protocols.

Conversely, the structural scaffold hypothesis maintains that the physical substrate of axonal bundles and synaptic architecture imposes hard constraints on the feasible dynamics of neural activity. According to this view, structural connectivity (SC) defines the latent eigenmodes of the brain, thereby governing the stability and repertoire of possible functional states. Empirical support for this model derives from observations that the spatial topology of structural connectomes explains a significant variance in FC matrices, often accounting for more robust inter-individual differences than task-evoked functional changes alone. Furthermore, lesion mapping studies suggest that damage to specific white matter tracts results in predictable and widespread disruptions of functional networks, highlighting the dependency of functional coherence on intact anatomical pathways. This structural determinism implies that functional reconfiguration cannot occur independently of the underlying wiring diagram; rather, it is modulated by the efficiency and capacity of the physical links between regions.

Methodological limitations complicate the definitive arbitration of these competing mechanisms. The temporal resolution disparities between hemodynamic fMRI signals, which capture activity on the order of seconds, and structural changes, which evolve over weeks or months, create an inferential gap that current analytical techniques struggle to bridge. While dynamic causal modeling and Granger causality have been applied to infer directionality, these methods are sensitive to noise and model specifications, leading to inconsistent findings across different cohorts and pathological conditions. Some studies have reported a bidirectional coupling where FC and SC influence each other reciprocally, particularly in higher-order association cortices such as the default mode network. In these regions, the weaker anatomical constraints may allow for greater experience-dependent plasticity, whereas primary sensory networks appear more rigidly bound by their structural wiring.

The controversy is further compounded by the role of gene expression and molecular mechanisms. While functional activity is known to trigger transcriptional programs essential for long-term potentiation and dendritic spine growth, the expression of these genes is itself regulated by the physical accessibility of transcriptional machinery, which is influenced by the local chromatin state and cytoskeletal architecture. Recent transcriptomic analyses indicate that baseline gene expression profiles in specific brain regions can predict both structural covariance patterns and functional network topology, suggesting a third variable—molecular phenotype—that may drive the observed structure-function correlations. Consequently, the strict dichotomy between functional primacy and structural scaffolding may represent a false binary; emerging evidence favors a complex interplay where rapid functional fluctuations operate within the boundaries set by slow-evolving structural anatomy, with reciprocal feedback loops operating at distinct timescales. Future research must integrate high-resolution temporal imaging with longitudinal molecular profiling to delineate the precise causal chain linking neural activity patterns to structural adaptation.

## Integrative Models and Biomarkers of Therapeutic Response

Recent theoretical frameworks have increasingly emphasized the temporal hierarchy of neural changes in successful treatment, positing that functional network dynamics act as a primary driver of subsequent structural plasticity. This integrative model suggests that early normalization of resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC), particularly the reduction of pathological hyperconnectivity within the default mode network (DMN) and the strengthening of anticorrelations between the DMN and frontoparietal control networks, constitutes a necessary antecedent to gray matter recovery. Empirical observations indicate that these rs-FC alterations often manifest within days of therapeutic intervention, serving as an early biomarker of eventual remission, whereas measurable changes in cortical thickness or hippocampal volume typically lag by 8 to 12 weeks. The structural remodeling is hypothesized to be a downstream consequence of restored network homeostasis, where functional disengagement of the salience network from limbic regions may permit neurotrophic cascades and synaptic consolidation in prefrontal and limbic cortices. Consequently, the predictive utility of rs-FC lies in its capacity to forecast this latent structural plasticity; patients demonstrating early functional connectivity signatures of network segregation are significantly more likely to exhibit long-term volumetric recovery and sustained clinical remission. These findings underscore the potential of multimodal imaging approaches, where early functional signatures are leveraged to predict later structural outcomes, thereby refining prognostic accuracy beyond unimodal metrics.
