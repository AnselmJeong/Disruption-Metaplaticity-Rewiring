# **Macro-Scale Neuroplasticity Induced by rTMS**

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is known to induce synaptic long-term potentiation and depression (LTP/LTD), but accumulating evidence indicates that rTMS also drives broader structural and network-level plasticity. For example, **gray matter** (GM) morphology can change rapidly after rTMS. In a landmark study, May et al. demonstrated that applying 1 Hz rTMS to the superior temporal (auditory) cortex caused detectable macroscopic increases in cortical gray matter within **5 days** . Using voxel-based morphometry (VBM), they found that continuous daily rTMS at 110% motor threshold produced GM expansion in the stimulated auditory cortex as early as one week of treatment . Notably, the authors argued that such rapid GM change must reflect fast cellular processes – for example, increased dendritic spine and synapse turnover – rather than slow neurogenesis or gliogenesis . In other words, rTMS can engage “fast-adjusting” neuronal mechanisms (synaptic and spine remodeling) to alter brain structure on a weekly timescale .

In **clinical settings**, similar macroscopic effects have been observed. In treatment-resistant depression, high-frequency rTMS targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has been associated with *increased gray matter volume and cortical thickness* in remote limbic regions. Structural MRI studies report post-treatment GM volume gains in the **anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), insula, hippocampus**, and temporal cortex. For example, Lan et al. (2016) found that repeated left-DLPFC rTMS significantly increased GM density in the left ACC of depressed patients, and that the ACC volume increase correlated with clinical response . In a related study, volumetric gains were observed in the left insula, left superior temporal gyrus, and right angular gyrus following a course of left-DLPFC rTMS, alongside an increase in hippocampal volume . These findings indicate that rTMS can produce structural plasticity not only at the stimulation site but also in connected networks (e.g. fronto-limbic areas) – and that at least some of these changes (notably ACC hypertrophy) track with symptom improvement . Together, these results underline that *rTMS can remodel cortical morphology at a macro scale*, presumably via synaptic/spine mechanisms, with measurable effects on mood-regulating regions.

# **White-Matter Integrity Changes**

rTMS also alters **white matter** (WM) microstructure. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies show that excitatory protocols tend to increase fractional anisotropy (FA) – a marker of WM integrity – in tracts connected to the stimulation site. For instance, Allendorfer et al. applied intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) to the left-hemisphere language areas of post-stroke aphasia patients and observed significant **increases in FA** in left frontal white-matter tracts (including inferior/superior frontal gyri and anterior corpus callosum) as well as in bilateral temporal and parietal regions . The enhanced FA near the stimulation site was interpreted as reflecting improved fiber organization and synaptic connectivity – consistent with functional gains in language networks .

Similarly, in major depression, high-frequency left-DLPFC rTMS improves WM integrity. Peng et al. (2012) reported that young treatment-resistant depressed patients showed baseline FA deficits in the left middle frontal gyrus, which were *normalized* by active rTMS (15 Hz) but not sham. After treatment, FA in the left prefrontal WM significantly increased, and these FA gains correlated with symptom improvement . In other words, the antidepressant efficacy of rTMS was associated with enhanced anisotropy in local frontal tracts (DOI:10.1016/j.jad.2011.12.006) . These and related studies indicate that **both high-frequency and theta-burst rTMS can strengthen white-matter pathways**, presumably by promoting remyelination or axonal coherence, and that greater WM integrity often accompanies better clinical outcomes.

# **Functional Network Reconfiguration**

Beyond local structure, rTMS reshapes **brain network connectivity**. Resting-state fMRI studies show that both excitatory and inhibitory rTMS protocols tend to **augment functional connectivity** (FC) in distributed networks, often more so at distant sites than at the coil location. In other words, rTMS elicits system-wide reorganization of network dynamics. For example, after 10 Hz DLPFC rTMS for depression, patients exhibit increased FC between the stimulated DLPFC and regions of the default-mode and cognitive control networks, including the anterior and subgenual cingulate cortices . Importantly, the degree of FC change has been linked to symptom relief. In one study of >200 MDD patients, stronger negative (anticorrelated) connectivity between the left-DLPFC target and the subgenual ACC before treatment predicted better rTMS response, and post-treatment FC shifts in these fronto-cingulate pathways correlated with mood improvement . More broadly, global functional integration of the left DLPFC (its overall connectivity strength with the rest of the brain) has been found to increase in responders – suggesting that effective rTMS *“rewires”* prefrontal networks towards a healthier configuration.

Accelerated iTBS protocols also affect network connectivity. For instance, accelerated iTBS delivered over consecutive days was reported to shift patients’ FC patterns closer to those of healthy controls, with lasting effects up to a month post-treatment (DOI:10.1016/j.biopsych.2023.11.016). In summary, convergent evidence indicates that rTMS drives *network-level neuroplasticity*: it modulates not only the excitability of the stimulated cortex but also the synchronization and information flow across remote brain circuits. These remote effects likely underpin many clinical benefits of rTMS, as strengthened connectivity between prefrontal and limbic regions (e.g. DLPFC–ACC) has been repeatedly linked to better outcomes  .

# **Conclusion**

In sum, rTMS engages multi-scale plasticity. On the microscopic level, it induces LTP/LTD-like synaptic changes. At the mesoscopic/macroscopic level, it rapidly alters **gray-matter structure** (e.g. cortical volume and thickness) and **white-matter integrity** in and around stimulated networks, often within days  . Functionally, it reorganizes distributed brain networks, enhancing connectivity between the stimulation site and distal regions (especially fronto-cingulate circuitry) in a manner that correlates with therapeutic effects  . Together, these findings underscore that rTMS triggers a cascade of neuroplastic adaptations – from synapses to systems – that provide the biological substrate for its neuromodulatory and clinical effects.
