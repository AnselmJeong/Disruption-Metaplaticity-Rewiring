## Executive Summary

The therapeutic limitations of conventional monoamine-based pharmacotherapies have precipitated a paradigm shift toward neuroplasticity-based frameworks, wherein the clinical efficacy of antidepressant interventions is increasingly attributed to their capacity to reconfigure neural networks. Emerging evidence delineates a distinct temporal asymmetry in this process, wherein rapid-acting interventions precipitate an immediate, state-dependent reconfiguration of functional connectivity (FC) within minutes to hours. This acute functional shift, characterized by fluctuations in neuromodulatory tone and synaptic gain, is hypothesized to be driven by arousal-driven transitions across critical lines of stability, effectively permitting the neural system to escape maladaptive attractor states prior to any anatomical remodeling ([DOI: 10.64898/2025.12.29.696846](https://doi.org/10.64898/2025.12.29.696846)). Contemporary models of macroscale brain organization suggest that these dynamic changes in FC serve as the primary driver of network reconfiguration, acting as a flexible substrate for exploration that is subsequently stabilized by slower structural mechanisms ([DOI: 10.1038/s41583-024-00846-6](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41583-024-00846-6)).

The consolidation of these transient functional states into enduring behavioral recovery requires a delayed phase of structural plasticity, extending from days to weeks following the initial stimulus. This structural remodeling is mediated by complex molecular cascades, including the activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling, which facilitate spinogenesis, dendritic arborization, and synaptogenesis within corticolimbic circuits such as the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus ([DOI: 10.1177/20451253211036814](https://doi.org/10.1177/20451253211036814)). The transition from functional reconfiguration to structural consolidation represents the critical juncture for relapse prevention, as the physical reinforcement of synaptic connections stabilizes therapeutic gains; conversely, targeting the actin cytoskeleton has been highlighted as a potential strategy to disrupt maladaptive structural memories that underpin disease chronicity ([DOI: 10.2174/1871527314666150529145531](https://doi.org/10.2174/1871527314666150529145531)). However, the clinical validation of these mechanisms remains challenging, as current multimodal neuroimaging methodologies struggle to reconcile the disparate spatial and temporal scales of rapid hemodynamic fluctuations and gradual anatomical changes, necessitating advanced techniques to accurately quantify structure-function coupling in psychiatric populations ([DOI: 10.3390/brainsci15050446](https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci15050446)).

## Neuroplasticity Frameworks in Depression: From Monoamines to Network Dynamics

The historical dominance of the monoamine hypothesis, which posits that depression arises from deficiencies in serotonergic, noradrenergic, and dopaminergic neurotransmission, has been increasingly challenged by the limitations of conventional pharmacotherapies. While selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) remain mainstays of treatment, they are characterized by a significant therapeutic lag of weeks to months and fail to induce remission in approximately one-third of patients ([DOI: 10.70251/hyjr2348.24121128](https://doi.org/10.70251/hyjr2348.24121128)). Consequently, the field has pivoted toward a neuroplasticity framework of major depressive disorder (MDD), which conceptualizes the pathophysiology of depression not merely as a chemical imbalance but as a disorder of synaptic connectivity and structural neural architecture ([DOI: 10.1038/s41380-024-02625-2](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-024-02625-2)). This paradigm shift emphasizes the restoration of synaptic plasticity and the reversal of stress-induced neuronal atrophy, particularly within cortico-limbic circuits, as critical mechanisms for therapeutic action ([DOI: 10.25886/3J3W-ZX18](https://doi.org/10.25886/3J3W-ZX18)).

The discovery of ketamine’s rapid and sustained antidepressant effects has served as the primary catalyst for this evolving pathophysiological model. Unlike conventional monoaminergic agents, sub-anesthetic ketamine exerts its effects primarily through N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonism, which triggers a cascade of downstream signaling events culminating in synaptogenesis. Preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that ketamine induces a glutamate surge that activates the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), leading to the rapid formation of new dendritic spines in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) ([DOI: 10.1002/da.22501](https://doi.org/10.1002/da.22501)). The integrity of the mTORC1 pathway and its associated biomarkers is increasingly recognized as a crucial determinant of treatment response, providing a biological substrate for the "neuroplasticity hypothesis" and offering potential targets for early-phase drug development ([DOI: 10.1177/20451253211036814](https://doi.org/10.1177/20451253211036814)). Further supporting the centrality of plasticity pathways, novel compounds such as the TrkB agonist B11 have shown promise in preclinical models by activating the TrkB-CREB signaling axis, thereby promoting structural plasticity without the psychotomimetic side effects often associated with NMDAR antagonism ([DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.5c01750](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.5c01750)).

The scope of rapid-acting antidepressants (RAADs) has expanded beyond ketamine to include its enantiomers and other glutamatergic modulators. Both (R,S)-ketamine and (S)-ketamine (esketamine) have demonstrated efficacy in treatment-resistant populations, with pharmacometabolomic studies revealing distinct global metabolic signatures associated with rapid remission, thereby illuminating the systemic biological correlates of clinical response ([DOI: 10.1080/14737175.2019.1554434;](https://doi.org/10.1080/14737175.2019.1554434;) [DOI: 10.1038/tp.2016.145](https://doi.org/10.1038/tp.2016.145)). To mitigate the risks of abuse and dissociation associated with ketamine, researchers have developed esmethadone (REL-1017), an NMDAR antagonist with minimal opioid activity, which offers an oral route of administration and a rapid onset of action observed within days rather than weeks ([DOI: 10.9734/jammr/2025/v37i85919](https://doi.org/10.9734/jammr/2025/v37i85919)). Additionally, the neuroplasticity framework has been extended to GABAergic and cholinergic systems; zuranolone, a positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors, has demonstrated rapid efficacy in postpartum depression and MDD through a two-week treatment course, while transdermal scopolamine has shown rapid and sustained response in treatment-resistant cases, likely mediated through cholinergic modulation and downstream plasticity effects ([DOI: 10.1080/14656566.2023.2298340;](https://doi.org/10.1080/14656566.2023.2298340;) [DOI: 10.7759/cureus.68447](https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.68447)).

Emerging research also highlights the intersection of neuroplasticity with circadian biology and psychedelics. Circadian disruption is a known feature of MDD, and RAADs such as ketamine, as well as sleep deprivation therapy, appear to share overlapping effects on clock gene expression, suggesting that the resynchronization of circadian rhythms may be an adjunctive mechanism of rapid symptom relief ([DOI: 10.1038/s41386-021-01241-w](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41386-021-01241-w)). Similarly, psychedelic compounds are being investigated as next-generation RAADs, although preclinical models are essential to dissociate their hallucinogenic effects from their potential to induce neuroplasticity ([DOI: 10.1111/bph.17370](https://doi.org/10.1111/bph.17370)).

Parallel to pharmacological advancements, neuromodulation techniques are being reinterpreted through the lens of network dynamics and neuroplasticity. The Stanford Accelerified Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy (SAINT), an MRI-navigated form of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), has demonstrated high response rates in reducing suicidal ideation. Dynamic causal modeling of resting-state functional MRI data has identified specific neural pathway modulations that underpin these rapid antidepressant and anti-suicidal effects, reinforcing the concept that correcting large-scale network dysfunction is a viable mechanism for inducing neuroplastic change ([DOI: 10.1038/s41398-023-02707-9](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-023-02707-9)). Translational behavioral studies corroborate these distinct mechanisms; for instance, while conventional antidepressants like citalopram may improve probabilistic reversal learning by facilitating initial rule acquisition, rapid-acting agents such as ketamine and scopolamine exert distinct modulatory effects on feedback sensitivity and decision-making biases, mediated in part by the medial prefrontal cortex ([DOI: 10.1177/2398212820907177;](https://doi.org/10.1177/2398212820907177;) [DOI: 10.1038/s41386-020-00797-3](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41386-020-00797-3)). Ultimately, the integration of molecular, cellular, and network-level evidence points to a convergence of diverse treatment modalities on the restoration of synaptic and neural network plasticity, marking a fundamental evolution in the understanding and treatment of depression ([DOI: 10.1007/s00406-019-01061-6](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00406-019-01061-6)).

## Acute Functional Reconfiguration: Synaptic Gain and Network-Level Modulation

The immediate reconfiguration of functional connectivity observed in the minutes to hours following a neurointervention is characterized by a rapid, state-dependent shift in network dynamics that precedes any structural remodeling. These acute alterations are posited to arise from fluctuations in neuromodulatory tone—specifically global arousal—which modulates synaptic gain and drives the neural system across critical lines of stability. The critical roaming hypothesis provides a robust theoretical framework for these phenomena, demonstrating that arousal-driven transitions across critical lines are mathematically sufficient to reproduce the specific patterns of functional connectivity dynamics observed in human subjects ([DOI: 10.64898/2025.12.29.696846](https://doi.org/10.64898/2025.12.29.696846)). Within this model, the surge in neuromodulatory activity effectively tunes the brain's proximity to criticality, a state that maximizes dynamic range and informational capacity. Consequently, rather than merely activating discrete pathways, the intervention induces a global reconfiguration of network topology; this is evidenced by the rapid disintegration of canonical resting-state networks and a stochastic exploration of connectivity patterns. This mechanistic perspective highlights that acute network-level modulation is fundamentally a transition phenomenon driven by synaptic gain changes, where the brain traverses critical boundaries to facilitate immediate adaptive functional reorganization ([DOI: 10.64898/2025.12.29.696846](https://doi.org/10.64898/2025.12.29.696846)).

## Structural Consolidation and Morphological Adaptation: Time-Course of Remodeling

The consolidation of transient neuronal activity into enduring anatomical architecture represents a critical, delayed phase of neuroplasticity, extending from days to weeks following initial stimuli. This structural remodeling (SR) serves as the physical substrate for long-term behavioral adaptation and is characterized by spinogenesis, dendritic arborization, and synaptogenesis, primarily within the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus. Central to this process is the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, which functions as a primary intracellular hub translating neurotrophic and glutamatergic signals into the protein synthesis required for structural growth ([DOI: 10.1038/s41583-024-00876-0](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41583-024-00876-0)). Deficiencies in upstream regulators such as PKBβ/AKT2 significantly impair mTOR signaling, thereby compromising prefrontal cortical physiology and hippocampal plasticity ([DOI: 10.1038/s41380-020-00964-4](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-020-00964-4)).

The temporal dynamics of structural consolidation are often initiated by rapid molecular events that precipitate delayed morphological changes. For instance, while estradiol infusion into the dorsal hippocampus rapidly activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and mTOR within minutes, the resultant increase in spine density on CA1 pyramidal neurons is observed at 30 minutes and persists for at least 2 hours, with concomitant spinogenesis occurring in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) ([DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3135-15.2016](https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3135-15.2016)). This cross-regional coupling suggests that activity in the hippocampus can drive delayed structural remodeling in the PFC via ERK/mTOR-dependent mechanisms ([DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3135-15.2016](https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3135-15.2016)). Similarly, rapid-acting antidepressant interventions, such as ketamine, engage α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR)-driven Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) release and mTOR signaling to enhance structural plasticity in mesencephalic and dopaminergic neurons ([DOI: 10.1038/mp.2017.241](https://doi.org/10.1038/mp.2017.241)). The restoration of synapse number and function through BDNF-TrkB and mTOR cascades is a unifying mechanism for diverse antidepressant modalities, including electroconvulsive therapy and aerobic exercise ([DOI: 10.1152/jn.00516.2025](https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.00516.2025)).

Non-pharmacological neuromodulation protocols also elicit specific temporal profiles of structural consolidation. High-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) applied over the mPFC for a duration of five days is sufficient to increase dendritic spine density in both layer II/III and layer V pyramidal neurons, alongside increased dendritic complexity revealed by Sholl analysis ([DOI: 10.3389/fncel.2022.1082211](https://doi.org/10.3389/fncel.2022.1082211)). These morphological changes correlate with decreased immobility in behavioral despair paradigms, indicating that the structural consolidation period for rTMS-induced therapeutic effects may occur within a sub-weekly timeframe ([DOI: 10.3389/fncel.2022.1082211](https://doi.org/10.3389/fncel.2022.1082211)). In contrast, the stabilization of newly formed spines can persist for much longer durations; pharmacological enhancement of mTOR signaling via PTEN inhibition results in a long-lasting increase in immature-type dendritic spines in the auditory cortex, which persists for days and weeks and is associated with the enhancement of long-term fear memory ([DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0204-23.2023](https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0204-23.2023)).

The persistence and maturation of these structural adaptations are tightly regulated by the cytoskeleton and the balance between plasticity and stability. Vascular endothelial growth factor D (VEGFD) is essential for maintaining mature dendritic trees by influencing the actin cortex and reducing microtubule dynamics; interestingly, VEGFD is downregulated during synaptic activity-induced structural plasticity, suggesting that the suppression of stabilization factors is necessary to permit remodeling ([DOI: 10.1007/s00018-024-05357-2](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00018-024-05357-2)). Furthermore, the transduction of extracellular signals into intracellular cytoskeletal rearrangements relies on integrin receptors, particularly β1 integrins, which are crucial for spine formation during the adolescent development of the PFC ([DOI: 10.1096/fasebj.2019.33.1_supplement.449.1](https://doi.org/10.1096/fasebj.2019.33.1_supplement.449.1)).

While activation of mTOR and ERK pathways is typically associated with adaptive spinogenesis, the directionality of structural remodeling is highly context-dependent. For example, aggressive social interactions result in the dephosphorylation of mTOR in the mPFC of female Syrian hamsters, even as ERK1/2 is phosphorylated in the nucleus accumbens ([DOI: 10.3390/ijms24021379](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24021379)). This finding contrasts with the mTOR activation observed in therapeutic models and highlights that maladaptive or stress-related behaviors may utilize distinct signaling cascades to drive structural plasticity. Chronic stress paradigms generally induce dendritic atrophy and spine loss in the PFC and hippocampus, a process mediated in part by microglial activity ([DOI: 10.1038/npp.2015.171;](https://doi.org/10.1038/npp.2015.171;) [DOI: 10.1038/s41386-020-0720-1](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41386-020-0720-1)). Indeed, diazepam has been shown to limit microglia-mediated neuronal remodeling in the PFC following chronic unpredictable stress, thereby preserving neuronal architecture ([DOI: 10.1038/s41386-020-0720-1](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41386-020-0720-1)).

The capacity for structural consolidation is also severely constrained by biological factors such as aging. While stress-induced morphological remodeling is reversible in young subjects, aging is associated with a marked reduction in experience-dependent dendritic spine plasticity and a loss of structural resilience in the PFC ([DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0759-10.2010;](https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0759-10.2010;) [DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0839-11.2011](https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0839-11.2011)). Similarly, pathological states such as chronic pain or cocaine addiction promote maladaptive circuit remodeling. Cocaine exposure, for instance, leads to the loss of mGluR1-dependent long-term depression (LTD) and the accumulation of calcium-permeable AMPA receptors in the PFC, representing a distinct form of pathological synaptic consolidation ([DOI: 10.1080/01677063.2021.1931180](https://doi.org/10.1080/01677063.2021.1931180)).

Chronic pharmacological treatments like fluoxetine exert their therapeutic effects through delayed, cell-type-specific transcriptional changes. In parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons of the PFC, chronic fluoxetine treatment downregulates pathways involved in mitochondrial ATP production and ribosomal components while upregulating plasticity-associated biological pathways ([DOI: 10.1038/s41386-025-02219-8](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41386-025-02219-8)). Furthermore, fluoxetine's modulation of mTOR signaling in hypothalamic POMC neurons underscores the widespread impact of SSRIs on plasticity nodes beyond the cortex ([DOI: 10.1007/s12035-018-1052-6](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12035-018-1052-6)). In models of hormone-related depression, such as ovariectomy combined with chronic stress, resveratrol reverses depression-like behaviors and restores spine density in the hippocampus and mPFC via BDNF-associated structural synaptic remodeling ([DOI: 10.1097/FBP.0000000000000845](https://doi.org/10.1097/FBP.0000000000000845)). Collectively, these findings delineate a complex time-course of remodeling wherein initial molecular cascades, such as BDNF and mTOR activation, orchestrate a delayed but critical phase of structural consolidation that determines the long-term functional integrity of neural circuits.

## Temporal Asymmetry and Causal Interplay Between Functional and Structural Plasticity

Current frameworks of macroscale brain organization posit that the relationship between structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) is governed by a temporal asymmetry, wherein rapid, adaptive changes in FC serve as the primary driver of network reconfiguration, which is subsequently stabilized— or consolidated— by slower, structural remodeling ([DOI: 10.1038/s41583-024-00846-6](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41583-024-00846-6)). This hypothesis suggests that functional dynamics act as a flexible substrate for exploration and learning, navigating structural constraints via "detours" to optimize communication before any physical alteration of the anatomical scaffold occurs ([DOI: 10.1007/978-3-031-72069-7_35](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-72069-7_35)). The eventual consolidation of these functional patterns into stable structural architectures is thought to establish new attractor states, thereby encoding long-term behavioral or cognitive adaptations; conversely, the failure of this consolidation mechanism may underpin the vulnerability to relapse or the persistence of maladaptive network states in neuropsychiatric pathology.

Developmental trajectories provide compelling evidence for this time-dependent interplay, illustrating a shift from functional dominance to structural anchoring. In the immediate postnatal period, the brain exhibits significant decoupling, where functional patterns diverge from the underlying structural blueprint, particularly in early-maturing sensory areas ([DOI: 10.1073/pnas.2412729122](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2412729122)). This phenomenon suggests that during the first month of life, functional connectivity reconfigures rapidly, perhaps in response to environmental stimuli, prior to the maturation of dense structural connections. As development progresses into childhood and adolescence, however, a distinct trend toward increased SC-FC coupling is observed across higher-order networks, including the frontoparietal and default mode networks ([DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.11.557107](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.09.11.557107)). This strengthening of coupling with age supports the hypothesis that successful functional patterns are gradually "fixed" by structural consolidation, reducing system plasticity in favor of stability and efficiency.

The clinical implications of disrupted structural-functional coupling further elucidate the consequences of aberrant consolidation processes. In neurodevelopmental disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), an abnormally strong SC-FC coupling is observed, which correlates with impaired cognitive flexibility and altered neural oscillations ([DOI: 10.1063/5.0294575](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0294575)). This hyper-coupling suggests a premature or excessive rigidification of the network, potentially trapping the brain in a restricted repertoire of attractor states and limiting adaptive learning. Similarly, in Parkinson’s disease, the excitation-inhibition balance plays a critical role in modulating coupling strength; a lower E/I ratio is associated with more rigid SC-FC coupling along the cyto-architectonic hierarchy, implying that neurochemical deregulation can drive the pathological stabilization of network dynamics ([DOI: 10.1038/s41531-025-01028-6](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41531-025-01028-6)). These findings indicate that the formation of new, healthy attractor states requires a precise balance between functional flexibility and structural constraint.

Conversely, a failure to maintain the structural scaffold necessary to support functional integration is characteristic of neurodegenerative conditions. In Alzheimer’s disease and mild cognitive impairment, amyloid pathology is linked to aberrant SC-FC coupling, manifesting as a breakdown in the correspondence between anatomical wiring and functional co-activation ([DOI: 10.1007/s00259-025-07172-8](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00259-025-07172-8)). Advanced fixel-based analyses confirm that specific types of fiber-density coupling are disrupted in AD, correlating with cognitive decline ([DOI: 10.1162/netn_a_00461](https://doi.org/10.1162/netn_a_00461)). This decoupling likely represents the erosion of the structural anchors required to maintain stable functional attractor states, leading to the chaotic or dissociated network activity observed in dementia. Comparable mechanisms of decoupling are evident in chronic pain states; for instance, patients with postherpetic neuralgia exhibit a modular loss of SC-FC coupling, where the structural support for functional networks within specific modules is compromised, correlating with clinical pain and affective symptoms ([DOI: 10.1038/s41598-025-86908-w](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-86908-w)).

Furthermore, the dynamic nature of this causal interplay is highlighted by state-dependent factors, such as sleep deprivation and biological sex, which modulate the degree of coupling. In shift work disorder, attentional decline is associated with altered SC-FC coupling, suggesting that transient physiological stressors can temporarily disrupt the stabilization of functional networks ([DOI: 10.2147/NSS.S503303](https://doi.org/10.2147/NSS.S503303)). Research into sex differences has also revealed significant variability in dynamic structure–function coupling, implying that the temporal parameters of consolidation may differ fundamentally between demographic groups ([DOI: 10.1007/s11682-025-01036-3](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11682-025-01036-3)). Collectively, these findings underscore that structural plasticity does not occur in isolation but acts as a delayed, stabilizing response to functional dynamics; when this temporal coordination is perturbed—resulting in either pathological rigidity or insufficient consolidation—the brain's capacity to transition between or maintain adaptive attractor states is profoundly compromised.

## Methodological Approaches to Multimodal Neuroimaging of Plasticity

The elucidation of neuroplasticity mechanisms through neuroimaging necessitates a rigorous integration of structural and functional modalities, yet current methodological frameworks struggle to reconcile the disparate spatial and temporal scales of these data. Structural resilience (SR), typically indexed via cortical thickness mapping and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), offers a snapshot of macro- and micro-structural integrity but often lacks the sensitivity to capture dynamic reorganization in real-time. For instance, while T1-weighted morphometry can detect gross volumetric changes, such as the gray matter reduction observed in the prefrontal cortex in obesity ([DOI: 10.3390/brainsci15050446](https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci15050446)), it provides limited insight into the underlying microstructural drivers of this atrophy. Conversely, DTI measures like fractional anisotropy are sensitive to white matter microstructure but are fundamentally limited by their inability to resolve complex fiber crossings, which can obscure the nature of structural remodeling in conditions characterized by diffuse pathology ([DOI: 10.3389/fnins.2024.1428666](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2024.1428666)). Furthermore, the clinical utility of structural metrics is often constrained by cross-sectional study designs; in primary open-angle glaucoma, for example, reduced cortical thickness and decreased DTI-ALPS indices correlate with visual field progression ([DOI: 10.3389/fneur.2025.1659200](https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2025.1659200)), yet such correlational analyses fail to establish whether these structural alterations are causes or consequences of functional decline.

Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) serves as the primary modality for assessing functional connectivity (FC), offering a non-invasive metric of spontaneous low-frequency oscillations presumed to reflect network-level plasticity. However, the interpretation of rs-fMRI data in the context of plasticity is fraught with ambiguity. Changes in FC may represent compensatory recruitment, maladaptive dysconnectivity, or merely epiphenomena of structural damage, a distinction that is difficult to resolve without concurrent structural and metabolic data. In Long-COVID, alterations in rs-fMRI connectivity patterns correlate with persistent deficits in executive and attentional domains ([DOI: 10.3389/fneur.2024.1426881](https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2024.1426881)), but without longitudinal baselines, it remains unclear if these functional shifts facilitate recovery or signify enduring neural injury. The "inverse problem" of neuroimaging further complicates causality; the hemodynamic response measured by BOLD fMRI is an indirect proxy for neural activity, and decoupling between vascular and neural plasticity can lead to erroneous conclusions, particularly in populations with vascular comorbidities. This methodological noise is evident in schizophrenia research, where correlations between DTI-based structural connectivity and rs-fMRI functional connectivity are often region-specific and weak, suggesting that structural scaffolding does not strictly constrain dynamic functional reorganization ([DOI: 10.3390/brainsci12020156](https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci12020156)).

To address the limitations of unimodal approaches, the field is increasingly adopting multimodal frameworks that fuse structural and functional data, yet these approaches introduce significant computational and interpretive challenges. Advanced analytical techniques, such as hyperbolic kernel graph neural networks (HKGF), have been developed to model the hierarchical organization of brain networks by integrating DTI and rs-fMRI data in hyperbolic space rather than Euclidean space ([DOI: 10.48550/arXiv.2507.02908](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2507.02908)). These methods acknowledge that the brain's intrinsic geometry is better represented by non-linear structures, potentially offering superior sensitivity to the subtle reorganization associated with neurocognitive decline. Clinically, such integration has shown promise in improving outcome prediction; for example, the combined use of fMRI, rs-fMRI, and DTI has been demonstrated to enhance the prediction of verbal fluency outcomes following temporal lobe resection compared to single-modality approaches ([DOI: 10.3171/2014.9.JNS131422](https://doi.org/10.3171/2014.9.JNS131422)). Despite these advancements, a fundamental critique remains the misalignment of temporal resolution: DTI captures relatively stable structural properties evolving over months or years, whereas rs-fMRI reflects fluctuating functional states occurring over seconds. This temporal uncoupling hinders the establishment of causal chains, as seen in Alzheimer’s disease where structural disconnection may precede functional changes by years, or conversely, where functional hyperconnectivity might serve as a transient precursor to later atrophy ([DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0126310](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0126310)).

The establishment of causality in neuroimaging studies of plasticity is further hampered by the logistical challenges of longitudinal clinical research, which results in a literature dominated by cross-sectional findings that conflate disease state with individual variability. While longitudinal pre- and post-intervention designs are theoretically ideal for tracking plasticity, as demonstrated in systematic reviews of obesity interventions ([DOI: 10.3390/brainsci15050446](https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci15050446)), they are resource-intensive and vulnerable to high attrition rates. Consequently, many studies rely on genetic covariance or large-scale datasets to infer developmental trajectories; however, even genetic correlation studies between memory performance and multimodal imaging phenotypes (IDPs) struggle to distinguish between the genetic determinants of structure versus function ([DOI: 10.1002/alz70856_104003](https://doi.org/10.1002/alz70856_104003)). To mitigate the risk of false positives inherent in high-dimensional multimodal data, novel statistical approaches such as Bayesian multimodal local false discovery rate are being employed to identify robust biomarkers in disorders like late-life depression by borrowing strength across structural and functional modalities ([DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0289401](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0289401)). Nevertheless, without the capability to track dynamic physiological processes—such as glymphatic clearance now accessible via DTI-ALPS indices in stroke and fatigue research ([DOI: 10.3389/fnagi.2025.1583655](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnagi.2025.1583655))—in conjunction with network activity, the mechanistic underpinnings of plasticity remain partially obscured. Ultimately, accurate mapping of plastic changes requires the standardization of harmonized data collection, such as that undertaken by the BrainLat project, to ensure that observed differences reflect true biological reorganization rather than site-specific methodological variance ([DOI: 10.1038/s41597-023-02806-8](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-023-02806-8)).

## Clinical Translation: Biomarkers of Response and Relapse Prevention

The translation of neuroplasticity mechanisms into clinical practice necessitates a focus on the structural substrates that underpin long-term memory formation and maintenance, particularly regarding the persistence of addictive behaviors. The actin cytoskeleton has been identified as a critical molecular substrate for the structural consolidation of drug-associated memories, which drive the pathology of relapse in substance use disorders such as methamphetamine dependence ([DOI: 10.2174/1871527314666150529145531](https://doi.org/10.2174/1871527314666150529145531)). Consequently, the degree of actin polymerization and subsequent synaptic remodeling within key neural circuits offers a promising biomarker for relapse risk, as the physical stabilization of these synaptic structures correlates with the strength and persistence of addictive memory traces ([DOI: 10.2174/1871527314666150529145531](https://doi.org/10.2174/1871527314666150529145531)). From a therapeutic standpoint, targeting the actin cytoskeleton allows for the disruption of these consolidated structural changes, suggesting that the efficacy of interventions may be gauged by their ability to alter cytoskeletal dynamics ([DOI: 10.2174/1871527314666150529145531](https://doi.org/10.2174/1871527314666150529145531)). This mechanistic understanding implies that adjunctive interventions, including psychotherapy, likely require a permissive state of cytoskeletal plasticity to facilitate Hebbian stabilization of new, adaptive learning; if the actin network remains rigidly consolidated around drug cues, therapeutic efforts to restructure neural networks may be impeded ([DOI: 10.2174/1871527314666150529145531](https://doi.org/10.2174/1871527314666150529145531)). Therefore, assessing the integrity and plasticity of the actin cytoskeleton may provide a predictive index of treatment response, guiding the timing of pharmacological and behavioral interventions to maximize the destabilization of maladaptive memories and promote long-term recovery ([DOI: 10.2174/1871527314666150529145531](https://doi.org/10.2174/1871527314666150529145531)).
