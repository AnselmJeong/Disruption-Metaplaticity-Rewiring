# **Neuroplasticity after rTMS and Comparative Treatments**

## **rTMS-Induced Neuroplasticity**

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) induces use-dependent synaptic changes akin to long-term potentiation (LTP) or depression, depending on protocol. High-frequency (>5 Hz) rTMS generally **increases** cortical excitability and promotes LTP-like potentiation, whereas low-frequency (≤1 Hz) rTMS tends to **decrease** excitability and induce LTD-like effects . At the molecular level, rTMS modulates glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission: it enhances excitatory (glutamate) signaling and reduces inhibitory (GABA) tone, thereby shifting the excitation/inhibition balance towards plasticity . In parallel, repeated rTMS upregulates neurotrophic factors and plasticity-related genes (e.g. **BDNF**, c-Fos) in targeted cortex and connected regions . For example, left DLPFC stimulation (10 Hz) raises BDNF levels and other synaptic proteins, supporting new spine formation .

These cellular effects translate into network-level reorganization. rTMS causes local and remote connectivity changes – for instance, 10 Hz stimulation of motor cortex increases regional homogeneity and connectivity in sensorimotor and cerebellar networks . Similarly, prefrontal rTMS alters fronto-limbic circuits: high-frequency left-DLPFC rTMS enhances resting activity in memory-related cortical sites (though it may reduce DLPFC–hippocampus coupling in some studies) . In general, neuroimaging shows that rTMS reshapes functional and structural brain networks in a dose-dependent manner . EEG/TMS-evoked potentials likewise reveal changes in cortical excitability thresholds after rTMS. These imaging/electrophysiological findings indicate that rTMS induces **intrinsic functional integration** changes reflecting neuroplastic adaptation .

- **Key synaptic mechanisms:** rTMS drives LTP/LTD-like synaptic efficacy changes, NMDA/AMPA receptor modulation, and postsynaptic density remodeling (e.g. PSD-95) . GABAergic inhibition is downregulated to permit plasticity, while glutamatergic transmission is facilitated .
- **Neurotrophic pathways:** rTMS boosts BDNF–TrkB signaling and other growth factors in stimulated cortex  . This upregulation enhances dendritic spine growth and synapse formation, analogous to other plasticity-inducing therapies.
- **Time course:** Acute rTMS sessions elicit immediate excitability changes (minutes to hours), but durable neuroplastic adaptations (e.g. changes in connectivity or gene expression) require repeated sessions over days–weeks  . Clinical effects typically emerge after ~2–4 weeks of daily rTMS, reflecting cumulative plastic changes.
- **Network impact:** rTMS-induced plasticity is focal but network-wide. Stimulating a node (e.g. DLPFC, M1) propagates changes through connected networks, reflected in fMRI connectivity and DTI tractography. For instance, motor cortex rTMS alters cerebrocerebellar loops , and prefrontal rTMS modifies default-mode and emotional regulation networks .



## **Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) and Neuroplasticity**

ECT induces generalized seizures that trigger **massive neuroplastic responses**. Animal models show that electroconvulsive shock produces widespread synaptic protein synthesis, neurogenesis and gliogenesis in hippocampus and cortex . In particular, ECT robustly increases expression of growth factors (BDNF, VEGF, etc.), synaptic structural proteins, and triggers dendritic sprouting across limbic–cortical regions . Thus, like rTMS, ECT engages LTP-like processes and neurotrophic pathways, but in a **global** and intense manner (via seizure) rather than focal magnetic pulses.

- **Structural changes:** Human MRI studies find that ECT enlarges gray matter in limbic/paralimbic areas. For example, ACC, hippocampus, temporal, entorhinal and ventral prefrontal cortices all show **increased thickness or volume** after ECT . These volumetric gains correlate with clinical improvement and may reflect synaptogenesis or reduced stress-related atrophy. By contrast, rTMS effects on structure are subtler (often seen only as functional connectivity changes), whereas ECT consistently drives measurable neuroanatomical growth .
- **Functional reorganization:** ECT also normalizes network function. Resting-state fMRI after ECT shows strengthened prefrontal–limbic coupling and changes in hippocampal–cortical connectivity (e.g. enhanced prefrontal regulation of limbic areas). These shifts mirror symptom relief but are often complex. rTMS similarly alters such networks, but ECT’s seizure engages nearly all circuits. For instance, PET studies of ECT-treated depression show reduced amygdala metabolism and altered monoamine signaling.
- **Molecular factors:** Like rTMS, ECT upregulates BDNF, though human findings are mixed . Animal work indicates ECT raises hippocampal BDNF and downstream mTOR signaling, promoting synaptic formation. However, clinical studies report variable BDNF changes post-ECT, possibly due to timing. Both interventions ultimately converge on enhancing BDNF–TrkB–mTOR cascades  .
- **Time course:** ECT has a rapid clinical onset (often full response in 2–4 weeks, over ~6–12 sessions) – faster than most SSRIs and comparable to the time frame of a full rTMS course. In contrast, single rTMS sessions produce transient excitation, but a therapeutic course is needed for lasting effect. Immediately, ECT seizures acutely increase cortical excitability, whereas rTMS modulates excitability more gradually.
- **rTMS vs. ECT:** Both elevate plasticity, but differ in scope. rTMS targets specific cortical nodes (e.g. DLPFC) and modulates defined networks  , while ECT recruits nearly entire brain. ECT’s seizure-mediated effects yield larger volume and connectivity changes (especially hippocampus/ACC) , whereas rTMS yields more circumscribed functional shifts. ECT can produce immediate global reorganization, but requires anesthesia and causes transient amnesia. rTMS is safer and focal, with fewer side effects, inducing more subtle but still significant plasticity  .



## **Psychedelic-Induced Neuroplasticity (Psilocybin, LSD, Ketamine)**

**Classical psychedelics** (psilocybin, LSD) and the NMDA antagonist ketamine each trigger a rapid burst of synaptic plasticity. Mechanistically, psychedelics bind 5-HT_2A receptors on cortical pyramidal neurons, causing a glutamate surge that secondarily activates BDNF/TrkB and mTOR pathways. Remarkably, recent work shows LSD and psilocybin metabolites bind **directly to TrkB receptors** with high affinity, allosterically amplifying BDNF signaling . Ketamine’s blockade of NMDA receptors disinhibits glutamate release and similarly engages BDNF/mTOR cascades. In all cases, these drugs potently drive new synapse formation: cultured cortical neurons exposed to DMT, DOI or LSD show dramatic dendritic sprouting and spinogenesis within 24 h . In vivo, a single dose of DMT or ketamine *doubles* spine density on prefrontal pyramidal cells after 24 h, compared to controls . These new spines correspond with functional changes: for example, DMT-treated rat cortex exhibits increased frequency and amplitude of spontaneous EPSCs, paralleling ketamine’s effects . Crucially, blocking TrkB with an antagonist abolishes the spinogenesis induced by psychedelics , underscoring BDNF dependence.

- **Spinogenesis and synaptogenesis:** Psychedelics robustly increase dendritic branch complexity and spine number. Experiments show **all tested hallucinogens (LSD, DOI, psilocin)** promote neurite outgrowth and new spine formation to an even greater extent than ketamine  . In cortical cultures, LSD nearly *doubles* spine density within one day . In rodents, a single injection of psilocybin or DMT yields spine formation in frontal cortex that persists beyond the drug’s clearance (e.g. DMT’s half-life ~15 min, yet spines still increased after 24 h)  . Such changes likely underlie the enduring therapeutic effects.
- **Network-level changes:** Acutely, classic psychedelics induce profound network desynchronization: fMRI studies report decreased connectivity and metabolism in the default-mode network (DMN) and a breakdown of normal hierarchical processing . This acute “desegregation” (increased entropy) may allow reorganization of maladaptive circuits. Over the following days to weeks, more coherent network patterns return, often with increased connectivity between previously segregated regions (e.g. enhanced prefrontal–limbic coupling). By contrast, rTMS more subtly biases existing networks without inducing a gross global reset.
- **Molecular pathways:** Psychedelics’ effects converge on the same plasticity cascades as rTMS and ECT – upregulating BDNF and synaptic proteins – but do so via different receptors. Psilocin and LSD trigger immediate early genes (c-Fos, Arc) and increase neurotrophic factors in the cortex and hippocampus. Ketamine quickly increases hippocampal BDNF and activates mTORC1, driving rapid synaptogenesis  . SSRIs also engage BDNF (see below), but require weeks of treatment, whereas psychedelics elicit BDNF release within hours.
- **Time course:** Psychedelic effects on plasticity are very rapid: structural and functional changes appear within hours and peak around 24–48 h after dosing  . Remarkably, these changes can be durable: a single psychedelic session can produce mood and cognitive benefits lasting weeks to months, likely sustained by the induced synaptic rewiring. In contrast, rTMS requires repeated sessions for cumulative effect, and SSRIs take even longer.
- **Comparison with rTMS:** Both approaches enhance cortical excitatory synaptic strength and promote spine growth, but via distinct means. rTMS uses focal magnetic pulses to induce endogenous plasticity, whereas psychedelics use pharmacology to flood cortical circuits with neurotransmitter and neurotrophic signaling. Psychedelics tend to produce larger structural changes in short time (e.g. generalized cortical spinogenesis ), and their brain-state effects are systemic (altered consciousness, global network reset). rTMS effects are more circumscribed and incremental. Nonetheless, both ultimately raise BDNF-TrkB activity   and can “unlock” plasticity (in fact, combining serotonergic psychedelics with rTMS is an area of active research).

## **SSRI-Induced Neuroplasticity**

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) promote plasticity indirectly by elevating synaptic 5-HT over chronic treatment. This enhanced serotonin signaling slowly remodels neural circuits via gene expression and neurotrophic mechanisms. Clinically relevant plastic changes require **weeks of SSRI use**. For example, chronic fluoxetine reverses stress-induced hippocampal damage: after 7–14 days of fluoxetine in depressed rats, dentate gyrus neurons show reduced apoptosis and a surge in cell proliferation (increased BrdU+ cells) . Fluoxetine and other SSRIs also restore LTP that is impaired by chronic stress. These effects are mediated by downstream factors such as BDNF: SSRIs upregulate BDNF–TrkB signaling and other plasticity genes in hippocampus and cortex, although the increases are gradual and sometimes modest. Notably, major antidepressants **directly bind TrkB** to enhance plasticity – for instance, fluoxetine is known to allosterically potentiate BDNF/TrkB signaling  (as with psychedelics and ketamine ).

- **Hippocampal neurogenesis:** A hallmark of SSRI plasticity is enhanced adult neurogenesis. Chronic SSRI treatment expands the newborn neuron pool in the dentate gyrus. This effect emerges over weeks (e.g. fluoxetine’s trophic effects seen after 3–4 weeks) and is believed to underlie the delayed therapeutic onset. By contrast, neither rTMS nor ECT is typically described as driving neurogenesis (ECT’s volumetric increases largely reflect synaptic remodeling/glial proliferation rather than new neurons).
- **Synaptic remodeling:** SSRIs gradually increase dendritic spine density and synaptic markers in cortex and hippocampus. Animal studies show fluoxetine can restore stress-induced loss of dendritic spines on CA3/CA1 neurons and prefrontal pyramidal cells. These synaptic changes occur over time and may require environmental enrichment to fully manifest (SSRIs are known to reopen a juvenile-like plasticity window that permits rewiring). In this way, SSRI-induced plasticity is more **experience-dependent**, whereas rTMS can directly drive synaptogenesis through stimulation protocols.
- **Connectivity and imaging:** Chronic SSRI use leads to macroscopic brain changes detectable by MRI. For example, successful SSRI treatment is associated with increased hippocampal volume and normalization of prefrontal and striatal gray matter . Functional imaging shows SSRIs gradually decrease amygdala hyper-reactivity and increase prefrontal regulatory tone during emotional tasks. These changes resemble some rTMS effects on mood circuits but evolve much more slowly.
- **Time course and differences:** SSRIs require 4–8 weeks to elicit appreciable plasticity, much longer than rTMS (weeks) or psychedelics (hours–days). Their onset of action parallels the time needed to induce gene transcription and neuron remodeling. Unlike the direct cortical drive of rTMS, SSRIs work diffusely via serotonergic projections. Both ultimately tap into the BDNF/mTOR pathway , but SSRIs do so indirectly. A key difference is that SSRIs do not produce immediate electrophysiological or network disruptions; rather, they set the stage for gradual rewiring and improved network homeostasis.

## **Summary of Comparisons**

In sum, all four modalities converge on **enhancing synaptic plasticity and network reorganization** in mood-relevant circuits, but via different levers. rTMS modulates cortical excitability and neurotransmission (targeted LTP-like effects)  . ECT evokes a global seizure to powerfully upregulate neurotrophins and induce widespread gray matter growth  . Psychedelic drugs acutely flood the cortex with glutamate and directly activate BDNF/TrkB, producing rapid spinogenesis and functional rewiring  . SSRIs chronically boost serotonin, leading slowly to neurogenesis and spine formation mediated by downstream factors like BDNF  .

Despite these differences, common features emerge: all increase **BDNF signaling** and AMPA-receptor-mediated synaptic strength. Imaging/electrophysiology supports this: for example, both rTMS and ECT can increase perfusion and functional connectivity in prefrontal and limbic regions, psychedelics acutely alter DMN coherence, and SSRIs gradually normalize dysregulated networks. The *time course* is a major distinguishing factor – psychedelics act within hours, ECT within days–weeks, rTMS over weeks, and SSRIs over weeks–months. Brain region specificity also varies: rTMS is focal (e.g. DLPFC, M1), ECT is global (notably hippocampus/ACC), psychedelics primarily engage cortex (especially PFC) and thalamocortical networks, and SSRIs broadly modulate serotonergic targets (hippocampus, cortex, amygdala). In every case, evidence of enhanced synaptic plasticity – whether increased spine density , potentiated evoked potentials, or volumetric growth  – underlies their therapeutic impact.

**Sources:** Recent reviews and studies (2019–2025) detailing molecular, electrophysiological, and imaging findings in rTMS, ECT, psychedelics, and SSRI treatments        . These indicate that while each modality employs distinct triggers (magnetic, electric, pharmacological), all ultimately harness neuroplasticity via overlapping mechanisms (BDNF/mTOR, glutamate/GABA modulation, synaptic remodeling) to reshape dysfunctional brain circuits.
