In clinical psychiatry, the combination of Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) and pharmacotherapy for treatment-resistant patients is no longer an exception but one of standard therapeutic approaches. Particularly in patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), ECT is known to induce rapid remission; however, this acute effect is often not sustained over a long period [@jelovac2013]. According to a study by Sackeim et al.[@sackeimEtAl2001], 84% of patients who achieved remission after ECT relapsed within six months when no subsequent pharmacological maintenance therapy was provided, whereas the relapse rate remained at 39% in the group treated with concurrent pharmacotherapy.

A similar pattern is observed in schizophrenia. When ECT was applied to refractory patients who were unresponsive to drug therapy, comparison across groups—pharmacotherapy alone, ECT alone, and combined pharmacotherapy/ECT—revealed that the combination therapy showed the most superior clinical response [@chanpattana1999]. Furthermore, it is not uncommon for patients who were refractory to pharmacotherapy, despite an adequate trial of high-dose medication, to regain clinical responsiveness to the same medications following a course of ECT. Petrides et al.[@petridesEtAl2015] reported that more than half of study participants with schizophrenia, who were previously unresponsive to clozapine, maintained remission when clozapine treatment was continued after a course of adjunct ECT. These results suggest that ECT does not merely alleviate symptoms temporarily but may also create conditions that alter the efficacy of subsequent pharmacological interventions.

Nonetheless, post-ECT pharmacotherapy has conventionally been understood primarily as a "means of preventing relapse." However, clinical practice reveals scenarios that are not fully captured by this interpretation. When active pharmacotherapy is implemented after ECT, some patients do not merely remain in a state of remission but continue to show improvement over time, accompanied by functional recovery. This implies that the two treatments do not simply act additively; rather, they may have synergistic effects that amplify each other’s efficacy. In another study, Sackeim et al.[@sackeimEtAl2009] reported that when antidepressants were combined with ECT, the remission rate was approximately 15% higher compared to the ECT alone.

These synergistic effects may be influenced by the patient's diagnosis or the type of medication, but they may also be dependent on the specific state of the patient at the time of intervention. In the aforementioned study by Sackeim et al.[@sackeimEtAl2009], superior clinical outcomes were observed when pharmacotherapy was initiated concurrently with ECT, rather than following the completion of the ECT course. This suggests that even for the same therapeutic intervention, significantly different results can be obtained depending on the timing of the intervention and the brain state at that moment.

Such observations expose the limitations of traditional views that regard psychopathology as fixed or static conditions. Instead, it is often advantageous to view an individual's mental state as a dynamical system that evolves over time within a multidimensional state space. Recently, some scholars have conceptualized mental disorders as being trapped in specific regions or repeatedly being drawn into pathological states within this state space. This framework elucidates why some patients exhibit treatment resistance and frequently relapse despite achieving remission after adequate treatment [@schefferEtAl2024a; @schefferEtAl2024b]. From this perspective, treatment resistance is regarded as the system being deeply entrenched in a "valley" of the state space, or a basin of attraction. Similarly, relapse is understood as the system sliding back into the same pathological space.

Meanwhile, Ousdal et al.[@ousdalEtAl2022] described the mechanism of ECT as a multiphase process of disruption, plasticity, and rewiring of neural circuits. According to this model, a powerful perturbation (electrical stimulation and seizure) temporarily disrupts malfunctioning neural circuits and subsequently opens a window of plasticity, providing conditions for the formation of new structures [@erchinger2023]. This conceptualization aligns naturally with the dynamical systems perspective, which emphasizes the process where the landscape of the state space is altered by strong perturbation and subsequently reconfigured into a more stable topography.

Based on these discussions, this paper proposes the "Disruption–Metaplasticity–Rewiring (DMR)" hypothesis as a conceptual framework to explain the mechanism of ECT by integrating dynamical systems theory and neuroplasticity theory. This hypothesis understands ECT not merely as a tool for symptom relief but as a catalyst for state space remodeling, and it reinterprets subsequent pharmacotherapy as a process of rewiring neural circuits and stabilizing the state space.
