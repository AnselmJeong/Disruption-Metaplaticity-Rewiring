The Default Mode Network (DMN) serves as a fundamental large-scale brain system supporting internal mental processes, including self-referential thought, autobiographical memory retrieval, and future simulation [@Menon2011; @Sheline2010]. In major depressive disorder (MDD), the DMN is not merely "overactive"; rather, the internal architecture of the DMN and its interactions with other networks become pathologically rigid, sustaining maladaptive rumination and impairing cognitive flexibility [@Sinha2021].

At the center of this network lies the posterior core, comprised of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and precuneus, which orchestrate global network integration and state regulation [@Sinha2019]. This core interfaces with the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to modulate self-evaluative and affective processing, while connections with the angular gyrus and posterior temporal regions facilitate the construction of autobiographical memory and meaning-based self-narratives. Furthermore, the hippocampus couples with the DMN to form a memory-based loop that anchors current self-perception to past experiences.

Describing post-ECT changes purely in terms of connectivity increases or decreases often obscures the underlying neurobiological reality. Functional connectivity is inherently dynamic, and recovery from depression is more accurately characterized as a process of network reorganization [@Wang2018]. For instance, while the DMN and executive control networks (ECN/CEN) typically exhibit inhibitory, anti-correlated relationships in the healthy brain, this reciprocal antagonism is often compromised in MDD [@Abbott2013; @Wei2018]. Similarly, the PCC—a central hub of the DMN—shows weakened integration with other DMN components in depression, which is selectively restored following ECT, indicating a recovery of its regulatory influence [@Bracht2023; @Sinha2021]. In this framework, ECT is viewed as an intervention that transiently deconstructs pathologically fixed states to permit adaptive reorganization.

The relationship between the anterior and posterior subsystems of the DMN also undergoes significant shifting. Post-ECT increases in connectivity between the posterior core and prefrontal regions (mPFC or DLPFC) suggest that self-referential processing is brought back under the influence of cognitive control networks [@Abbott2013; @Cano2016]. Moreover, the coherence between the precuneus and angular gyrus represents a sub-module specialized for integrating experience into a coherent self-narrative; this coherence is typically diminished in MDD and selectively recovers only in clinical responders [@Mulders2016].

The theme of transient deconstruction and subsequent reorganization is particularly evident in hippocampal-DMN dynamics. Immediately following ECT, a temporary decoupling or disruption of hippocampal-DMN connectivity is observed [@Gbyl2024]. This "hippocampal–DMN dissociation" impairs the retrieval of autobiographical memories, leading to transient cognitive side effects where patients experience difficulty recalling events surrounding the treatment period. However, this disruption of connectivity typically recovers over time, suggesting that ECT does not permanently damage memory-related circuits but rather reorganizes the interface between memory systems and self-referential thought [@Takamiya2023].

From a more macroscopic perspective, connectivity between large-scale networks—including the DMN, ECN, and salience network (SN)—appears to correlate with both the symptoms of depression and the clinical response to ECT. According to the triple network model, the SN serves as a dynamic switch that mediates transitions between the DMN and CEN [@Menon2011]. In patients with MDD prior to ECT, the SN often fails to facilitate appropriate network switching, characterized by indirect pathological connectivity. Following ECT, however, direct inter-network communication is normalized [@Chibaatar2023].

Beyond the canonical large-scale networks, functional connectivity among key integration modules—including the amygdala, thalamus, and striatum—is also modulated by ECT. Regions recurrently identified in seed-based or Independent Component Analysis (ICA)—such as the hippocampus, amygdala, subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC), PCC, and DLPFC—are not merely anatomical regions of interest but critical hubs linking affect, memory, self-reference, and cognitive control.

The hippocampal-thalamo-striatal circuit contextually filters experience and assigns emotional valence before bridging to behavioral selection; in healthy states, its synaptic weights are flexibly adjusted. Clinical responders often exhibit a post-ECT decrease in connectivity within this circuit. Rather than representing "functional decline," this suggests a loosening of the pathologically rigid associations between memory, affect, and behavior that characterize the depressive state [@Gbyl2024].

Similarly, amygdala-DLPFC connectivity serves as a conduit for placing bottom-up emotional responses under prefrontal regulation. Findings that this connectivity increases post-ECT and correlates with symptomatic improvement suggest that emotional reactivity has regained a negotiable relationship with cognitive control networks [@Domke2023].

The sgACC is a hallmark of MDD pathology, typically exhibiting hyperactivation and strengthening maladaptive affect through abnormal DMN coupling. ECT reorganizes the connectivity between the sgACC, DMN, and prefrontal cortex. Following successful treatment, the pathological influence of the sgACC is attenuated, accompanied by a restoration of inhibitory connectivity from higher cognitive regions such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) [@Xu2020;@Wang2024]. This recovery of top-down control is a primary mechanism facilitating emotional resilience in patients.

Amplitude of Low-Frequency Fluctuations (ALFF), fractional ALFF (fALFF), and Regional Homogeneity (ReHo) are common metrics in functional connectivity research, reflecting the spontaneous activity of specific brain regions even in the absence of external stimuli [@Ming2007].

Reports of ALFF/fALFF changes in MDD are inconsistent, with both increases and decreases observed depending on the region. A transdiagnostic study by Wang et al. (2022) reported significant ALFF/fALFF increases across various psychiatric disorders in the left orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC), right anterior insula (AI), and caudate. While universal interpretative principles for ALFF/fALFF remain elusive, increased resting-state activity is often interpreted as a fixed, persistently engaged state that occurs regardless of task or context. The post-ECT reduction in these metrics [@Qiu2019;@Li2021] likely represents the suppression of unnecessary, constant engagement, thereby enabling transitions to alternative network states.

In summary, functional connectivity changes between brain modules and integration hubs following ECT are complex and context-dependent, making simple directional generalizations difficult. Crucially, rather than interpreting connectivity changes as simple increases or decreases in "function," it is more plausible that ECT restores the delicate balance between modular autonomy and network integration that is disrupted in psychiatric disorders.
