## Executive Summary

This systematic review evaluates combination therapies for treatment-resistant depression (TRD) that share neuroplasticity-modulating mechanisms. Evidence synthesis reveals that rTMS/tDCS combined with SSRIs demonstrates the most robust evidence base, while esketamine with oral antidepressants represents the only FDA-approved psychedelic combination. In contrast, ECT-ketamine combinations have failed to demonstrate synergistic effects despite theoretical expectations, and brain stimulation-psychedelic combinations remain a promising but RCT-lacking emerging area. The "disruption → metaplasticity → rewiring" framework provides a useful heuristic for understanding when combination therapies succeed or fail.

## Part I: ECT and SSRI/Antipsychotic Combinations

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) combined with antidepressants represents the most historically established combination, with its most decisive role in **relapse prevention**. In the landmark study by Sackeim et al. (2001), patients achieving remission with ECT but receiving no continuation treatment showed an alarming **84% relapse rate** within 6 months; however, nortriptyline-lithium combination reduced this to **39%** (10.1001/jama.285.10.1299).

The **PRIDE study (Prolonging Remission in Depressed Elderly)** established efficacy in geriatric severe depression. Kellner et al. (2016) demonstrated that right unilateral ultrabrief ECT combined with venlafaxine achieved **61.7% remission** and **70% response** rates in 240 elderly patients (10.1176/appi.ajp.2016.15081101). Phase 2 continuation data showed significantly lower Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores at 24 weeks in the continuation ECT plus medication group compared to medication alone (5.5 vs. 9.4; 10.1176/appi.ajp.2016.16010118).

The importance of early SSRI initiation was demonstrated in Yildiz et al.'s RCT (2010). Early sertraline initiation (150 mg/day from ECT session 4) yielded only **12.5% relapse** versus 28% for post-ECT initiation and **67%** for placebo (10.1097/YCT.0b013e3181c189f7). These findings support the hypothesis that pharmacological intervention during the ECT-induced neuroplasticity window optimizes consolidation of therapeutic network reorganization.

A recent meta-analysis of 11 RCTs (N=1,254) by Sun et al. (2026) confirmed that ECT-antidepressant combinations yield significant symptomatic improvement (SMD=0.29, 95% CI: -0.47 to -0.12, P=0.001) with higher remission rates without affecting seizure duration or adverse effects (10.1177/00912174251338962). Additional systematic review evidence (10.1177/0004867420952543) and naturalistic cohort data (10.3389/fpsyt.2024.1341508) support the feasibility and safety of combination pharmacotherapy during acute ECT courses without compromising treatment effectiveness.

**Mechanistic Interpretation**: Within the disruption–metaplasticity–rewiring framework, ECT provides high-amplitude network disruption (with downstream neuromodulatory cascades), while serotonergic agents shape the metaplasticity window and help consolidate ("rewire") toward a remission attractor. Both modalities converge on BDNF/TrkB signaling pathways; ECT increases 5-HT~1A~ receptor sensitivity and downregulates 5-HT~2~ receptors, with subsequent SSRI/SNRI treatment maintaining these serotonergic adaptations.

## Part II: ECT and Psychedelic/Esketamine Combinations

### Ketamine as ECT Anesthetic: Negative Findings

ECT-ketamine combination represents a paradigmatic case where **theoretical expectations were not empirically confirmed**. In the network meta-analysis by Liu et al. (2024) encompassing 17 RCTs (N=1,370), efficacy ranking was ECT > ketamine+ECT > ketamine > placebo. Critically, ketamine-ECT combination provided **no additional benefit** while increasing adverse reactions (PMID: 38744161).

The KANECT trial (Fernie et al., 2017) found no significant differences in depression scores or required ECT sessions between ketamine (up to 2 mg/kg) and propofol anesthesia (10.1192/bjp.bp.116.189134). Similarly, Anderson et al. (2017) reported limited antidepressant benefit from ketamine augmentation during ECT compared with saline (10.1016/S2215-0366(17)30077-9). Carspecken et al. (2018) also found no depression score differences between ketamine and methohexital anesthesia, although notably, **plasma BDNF elevation was observed only in the ketamine group** (PMID: 29847468). These findings align with the hypothesis that ketamine's NMDA receptor antagonism may block ECT-induced long-term potentiation (LTP).

### Esketamine: Emerging Promise for Cognitive Protection

For **esketamine**, Zeng et al. (2025) demonstrated non-inferiority to propofol on HAMD-17 reduction, though response rates (80% vs. 70%) and remission rates (65% vs. 55%) did not achieve non-inferiority thresholds (PMID: 39265871). However, promising results emerged regarding **cognitive protection**: a 2024 mechanistic study (PMID: 39265873) showed that both esketamine and ECT activate the **PI3K/Akt/GLT-1 pathway**, reducing glutamate levels, with synergistic improvement of depressive behaviors in animal models.

### Sequential Combination Protocols

Recent clinical innovation has focused on sequential rather than concurrent administration. A case series documented that pairing ECT with intranasal esketamine on non-ECT days enabled **sustained symptom improvement** and the ability to **extend ECT intervals** in maintenance frameworks for severe TRD (10.1097/YCT.0000000000001233). Additionally, a cohort study in ECT non-responders reported favorable outcomes with esketamine as a bridging strategy (10.1007/s00406-025-02041-9).

**Mechanistic Interpretation**: Esketamine/ketamine are best conceptualized as **metaplasticity amplifiers** that may stabilize a post-disruption trajectory. The emerging question is not "additive efficacy" per se, but how to schedule disruption and plasticity induction so that rewiring is consolidated rather than destabilized. The critical design variables include timing (simultaneous vs. sequential), cognitive burden management, and optimal spacing.

## Part III: ECT and rTMS/tDCS Combinations

### rTMS Priming Before ECT

The most developed evidence in this domain uses **rTMS as a priming intervention** to accelerate or potentiate ECT response. Conceptually, this represents a staged strategy: pre-conditioning cortical excitability and network gain before the major disruption.

A multicenter randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial demonstrated that **five sessions of neuronavigated left-DLPFC rTMS** prior to ECT improved early clinical response metrics compared with sham priming (10.1017/S0033291721003810). This finding supports the hypothesis that rTMS-induced metaplastic priming—through excitability tuning and gain modulation—renders subsequent ECT disruption more therapeutically directed and potentially reduces time-to-response.

### rTMS as ECT Maintenance Alternative

Most clinical research focuses on rTMS as maintenance therapy following ECT response. Noda et al. (2013) reported that in 6 TRD patients who responded to ECT but discontinued due to cognitive side effects, anesthesia concerns, or time burden, sequential bilateral rTMS (120% RMT; 600 pulses right low-frequency + 3000 pulses left high-frequency) administered 1-2 times weekly maintained response in **5 of 6 patients for 6-13 months** (10.3389/fpsyt.2013.00073).

Cristancho et al. (2013) demonstrated similar findings: among 6 maintenance ECT patients transitioned to maintenance TMS (average 1 session per 3.5 weeks), **67% (4/6) maintained response** at final observation (7-23 months), with 2 relapsing at 8-9 months (10.1097/YCT.0b013e31827a70ba). This 33% relapse rate compares favorably with the historical 37.1% for continuation ECT alone.

### Concurrent Administration: Cautionary Findings

Concurrent combination protocols require careful consideration. Hansen et al. (2011) found that low-frequency (1 Hz) right prefrontal rTMS added to ECT paradoxically showed a trend toward worse depression outcomes than sham (ECT alone), suggesting that **low-frequency rTMS may suppress ECT's therapeutic effects** (10.1097/YCT.0b013e3181d77645). In contrast, a 2024 Chinese retrospective study (N=116) found that high-frequency rTMS combined with ECT showed equivalent depression improvement while **preserving cognitive function**, suggesting that HF-rTMS may mitigate ECT-induced cognitive impairment.

### tDCS Protocols Under Investigation

For tDCS, the first RCT protocol for post-ECT cognitive recovery was registered in 2024 (ChiCTR2300071147). This study applies tDCS (2 mA, 30 minutes, 5 times weekly for 2 weeks) to left DLPFC (F3) within 2 days of ECT completion to assess cognitive recovery acceleration (10.1186/s12888-024-05567-9).

**Mechanistic Interpretation**: Neuroimaging research by Cano et al. (2023) demonstrates that ECT induces **structural neuroplasticity** (neurogenesis, synaptogenesis) in hippocampus and amygdala, whereas rTMS promotes **circuit-level functional reorganization** without macroscopic structural changes (10.1016/j.jad.2023.03.082). These complementary plasticity pathways provide the theoretical rationale for combination approaches.

## Part IV: rTMS/tDCS and SSRI/Antipsychotic Combinations

Brain stimulation combined with serotonergic antidepressants demonstrates the **most robust evidence base** among all combination therapies.

### rTMS-SSRI: Convergent Meta-Analytic Evidence

A 2024 eClinicalMedicine meta-analysis of 14 RCTs revealed a critical distinction: **SSRIs** significantly improve rTMS outcomes, whereas **SNRIs** show no significant effect (10.1016/S2589-5370(24)00339-0). This supports the mechanistic hypothesis that SSRIs (but not SNRIs) enhance cortical excitability and neuroplasticity, potentially "priming" TMS-induced plasticity changes.

Additional systematic reviews confirm that **active TMS combined with pre-specified antidepressants** outperforms **sham TMS with the same antidepressants** (10.1016/j.jad.2024.05.037), supporting pragmatic concurrent combination strategies. Individual-participant data meta-analysis has further characterized how concurrent antidepressant regimens moderate rTMS outcomes (10.1016/j.eclinm.2024.102728).

### SELECT-TDCS: Landmark Evidence for Additive Effects

The **SELECT-TDCS study** (Brunoni et al., 2013) established tDCS-SSRI additive effects in a 2×2 factorial RCT. Among 120 patients with moderate-to-severe nonpsychotic MDD, tDCS (2 mA, 30 minutes, 12 sessions) combined with sertraline 50 mg showed an **11.5-point MADRS difference** from placebo (95% CI: 6.03-17.10, p<0.001). Response rates were: combination **63.3%**, tDCS alone 43.3%, sertraline alone 33.3%, placebo 16.7% (10.1001/2013.jamapsychiatry.32). Notably, effects were **additive** (interaction p=0.48), and the combination group showed more treatment-emergent hypomania episodes (5 of 7), warranting monitoring.

However, the **DepressionDC study** (Burkhardt et al., 2023, Lancet) found no significant benefit when adding tDCS (21 sessions, 6 weeks) to stable SSRI treatment (N=160). Protocol differences—medication initiation timing, stimulation intensity, patient selection—may account for the discrepant results.

### ASCERTAIN-TRD: rTMS Superiority in Treatment-Resistant Cases

The **ASCERTAIN-TRD study** (Papakostas et al., 2024) compared rTMS augmentation, aripiprazole augmentation, and medication switch in TRD (≥2 antidepressant failures) in a large multicenter open-label effectiveness trial (N=278). rTMS augmentation showed MADRS change of **-17.39 points**, significantly superior to medication switch (-13.22, p=0.015). Response rates were: rTMS 52.2%, aripiprazole 38.1%, medication switch 35.8% (10.1038/s41380-024-02468-x).

**Mechanistic Interpretation**: Both TMS and serotonergic antidepressants enhance LTP in the hippocampal dentate gyrus and increase serotonin neurotransmission. SSRIs promote BDNF gene expression supporting neuronal survival and differentiation, while TMS modulates limbic serotonin release through DLPFC stimulation. The two modalities may achieve synergy through complementary **bottom-up** limbic downregulation and **top-down** prefrontal activation pathways.

## Part V: rTMS/tDCS and Psychedelic/Esketamine Combinations

This combination represents the **most promising emerging research area**, though completed RCTs remain absent.

### Systematic Review Evidence

Arubuolawe et al.'s 2024 systematic review analyzed 6 studies (3 case reports, 1 retrospective study, 1 preliminary study, 1 review), concluding that TMS-ketamine combination (CTK) produces **substantial and sustained symptom improvement** in TRD with higher efficacy than monotherapy and only mild, transient adverse effects (10.7759/cureus.64712).

### Long-Term Retrospective Evidence

**Best et al. (2019)** provide key evidence for concurrent protocols. In a retrospective study (N=28), simultaneous administration of 1 Hz rTMS (130% MT, 30-40 minutes, targeting anterior cingulate cortex) with IV ketamine (0.2-4.7 mg/kg) reduced CGI-S from 6.1 to 1.7. Critically, **effects were maintained at 2-year follow-up (CGI-S=1.4, p<0.0001)** (10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e02187). The authors noted that ketamine's analgesic effect enabled tolerance of higher TMS intensities.

### Case Reports of Sustained Remission

Elkrief et al. (2022) demonstrated a sequential approach in a 43-year-old male with bipolar I disorder and TRD. Two weeks of iTBS (600 pulses/session, 3×/day, left DLPFC) plus IV ketamine (0.5 mg/kg, 2×/week), followed by 10 weeks of bilateral cTBS/iTBS (48 sessions) plus IM ketamine (8 sessions), reduced MADRS from 38 to 4, with **complete remission maintained for 1 year** (10.3389/fpsyt.2022.986378).

### Negative Finding

Shanok et al.'s preliminary study (2024, N=235) found no significant difference in depression reduction between Deep TMS + IV ketamine (N=66) and TMS alone (N=169): response rates 80.3% vs. 76.9%, p=0.13 (10.1007/s00213-024-06573-1). Protocol differences (Deep TMS vs. conventional rTMS, ketamine dose/frequency) may contribute to divergent findings.

### Psilocybin-TMS Combinations

Currently, NCT06132178 is actively recruiting participants for a psilocybin-TMS combination trial, though no clinical data have been published. Theoretically, the combination of psychedelic-induced "critical period reopening" (Dölen et al., Nature 2023) with TMS-induced LTP could extend treatment effect durability.

**Mechanistic Interpretation**: Both modalities share BDNF upregulation, mTOR pathway activation, AMPA receptor potentiation, and enhanced glutamate neurotransmission. Dębowska et al. (2023) proposed that rTMS increases DLPFC cerebral blood flow while ketamine enhances prefrontal global functional connectivity, potentially achieving synergistic normalization of cortical functional connectivity (10.3389/fnins.2023.1267647).

## Part VI: Psychedelic and SSRI/Antipsychotic Combinations

### Esketamine-Oral Antidepressant: The FDA-Approved Benchmark

**Esketamine with oral antidepressants** is the only FDA-approved psychedelic combination. TRANSFORM-2 (Popova et al., 2019) demonstrated that esketamine nasal spray (56-84 mg, twice weekly) combined with newly initiated oral antidepressant (duloxetine, escitalopram, sertraline, or venlafaxine XR) showed a **-4.0 point MADRS difference** (95% CI: -7.31 to -0.64) versus placebo spray plus oral antidepressant at day 28 in 227 TRD patients (10.1176/appi.ajp.2019.19020172).

The **ESCAPE-TRD study** (NEJM, 2024) compared esketamine + SSRI/SNRI continuation versus quetiapine XR + SSRI/SNRI in a large RCT (N=676, 171 centers, 24 countries). Esketamine was **significantly superior** in both remission and relapse rates compared to quetiapine (10.1056/NEJMoa2304145).

### Psilocybin-SSRI: Challenging Traditional Assumptions

Traditional theory predicted that chronic SSRI use downregulates 5-HT~2A~ receptors, reducing psychedelic binding sites. However, recent clinical evidence partially refutes this.

COMPASS Pathways' phase 2 study (Goodwin et al., 2023) administered COMP360 psilocybin 25 mg to 19 TRD patients on stable SSRIs. At week 3, MADRS change was **-14.9 points** (95% CI: -20.7 to -9.2), with response and remission rates both **42.1%**. No serotonin syndrome occurred (10.1038/s41386-023-01648-7).

Becker et al. (2022) conducted a double-blind crossover RCT in 23 healthy volunteers, showing that escitalopram pretreatment (10 mg × 7 days → 20 mg × 7 days) **did not meaningfully affect psilocybin's positive mood effects** while **significantly reducing** anxiety, negative drug effects, and cardiovascular side effects. Crucially, **psilocybin-induced BDNF elevation was not significantly affected by escitalopram pretreatment** (10.1002/cpt.2487). This aligns with Vargas et al.'s (Science, 2023) proposal that psychedelics promote neuroplasticity via **intracellular 5-HT~2A~ receptors**, explaining why SSRIs—which increase extracellular serotonin—may not fully block psychedelic plasticity effects.

However, a contrasting finding emerged from post-hoc RCT analysis indicating that **discontinuation of SSRI/SNRI prior to psilocybin therapy** was associated with **reduced treatment effect** compared with unmedicated entrants (10.1177/02698811241237870). This raises questions about whether withdrawal/relapse dynamics confound baseline severity, or whether chronic serotonergic exposure induces receptor-level adaptations that paradoxically enhance psychedelic sensitivity.

### DMT-SSRI: Unexpected Enhancement

Small Pharma's phase 1/2 study (2023) of IV DMT (SPL026, 27.5 mg) found that SSRI-taking participants (N=18) showed **greater antidepressant effects** than non-medicated participants—a novel finding suggesting potential synergy rather than antagonism, possibly because standalone DMT (unlike ayahuasca) lacks MAOI components, reducing serotonin syndrome risk.

### Ayahuasca: Special Consideration

Ayahuasca requires distinct consideration. Palhano-Fontes et al.'s RCT (2019, N=29) showed significant antidepressant effects (Cohen's d=1.49) at day 7 MADRS. However, due to harmala alkaloid MAOIs in ayahuasca, **SSRI combination is contraindicated for serotonin syndrome risk** (10.1017/S0033291718001356).

### Antipsychotic-Psychedelic Interactions: Antagonistic Rather Than Synergistic

Antipsychotic-psychedelic combinations should be understood in terms of effect blockade rather than therapeutic synergy. Vollenweider et al. (1998) demonstrated that risperidone (5-HT~2A~/D~2~ antagonist, 0.5-1 mg) pretreatment **dose-dependently blocked psilocybin effects by 69-99%**, with ketanserin (5-HT~2A~ antagonist) achieving complete blockade. Conversely, haloperidol (D~2~ antagonist) failed to block perceptual effects while **increasing** anxiety and "ego dissolution fear"—clearly demonstrating that psychedelic experiences are mediated by **5-HT~2A~**, not dopamine D~2~, receptors.

---

## Conclusions: Mechanistic Convergence and Clinical Implications

### Key Findings and Theoretical Implications

This systematic review reveals that combination therapies targeting neuroplasticity do not always align with theoretical expectations.

**ECT-ketamine combination** failed to demonstrate synergy despite shared NMDA/glutamate pathways, suggesting that ketamine's NMDA antagonism may paradoxically block ECT-induced LTP. This finding underscores the importance of considering not just shared pathways but potential mechanistic interference.

**rTMS/tDCS-SSRI combination** demonstrates validated additive or synergistic effects through convergent BDNF-mediated synaptic plasticity and complementary bottom-up/top-down regulatory pathways. The meta-analytic finding that SSRIs but not SNRIs enhance rTMS outcomes supports the hypothesis that SSRIs prime cortical excitability for stimulation-induced plasticity.

**rTMS-ketamine combination**, despite limited evidence, shows promising 2-year sustained effects (Best et al., 2019), with mechanistic convergence on BDNF, mTOR, and AMPA pathways providing theoretical foundation.

**Psychedelic-SSRI combination** challenges traditional 5-HT~2A~ competition hypotheses based on recent clinical evidence, with intracellular 5-HT~2A~ receptor-mediated plasticity emerging as a new paradigm.

### Clinical Recommendations

1. **ECT continuation therapy**: Early initiation of SSRI/SNRI is essential during the ECT-induced plasticity window
2. **rTMS augmentation**: SSRIs preferred over SNRIs based on differential efficacy evidence
3. **Esketamine therapy**: Oral antidepressant combination is mandated per FDA-approved protocol
4. **Psychedelic therapy**: SSRI discontinuation may not be necessary—emerging evidence suggests potential enhancement rather than antagonism

### Future Directions

Large-scale RCTs are needed to establish optimal combination protocols, particularly for:

- rTMS + ketamine/esketamine combinations
- TMS + psilocybin combinations
- Sequential versus concurrent administration timing
- Personalized combination selection based on biomarkers

The disruption–metaplasticity–rewiring framework provides a useful heuristic for future protocol design: determining optimal timing of disruption (ECT, psychedelics, ketamine) relative to plasticity modulators (rTMS, SSRIs) and consolidation supports (psychotherapy, sleep optimization) represents the critical challenge for next-generation combination therapies.
