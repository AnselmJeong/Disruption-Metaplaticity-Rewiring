The treatment modalities discussed in this review all owe their therapeutic effects to modulating neuroplasticity. Consequently, it might be assumed that combining these interventions would yield only additive effects or that outcomes would be dominated by the more potent modality. However, clinical evidence suggests that combination therapies yield unforseen effect.

The most unexpected finding may be seen from the combination of ECT and ketamine. Across multiple RCTs, ketamine anesthesia during ECT fails to improve outcomes and may actively interfere with therapeutic mechanisms (10.1016/j.jpsychires.2024.05.022; 10.1192/bjp.bp.116.189134; 10.1016/S2215-0366(17)30077-9). This pattern challenges the naive assumption of "the more the better" and suggests that the timing and order of combination therapy matter as much as their individual potency.

Other combination therapies that have shown success paints a more positive picture. Antidepressant use before rTMS induces a priming of cortical excitability which augment stimulation-induced plasticity (10.1016/S2589-5370(24)00339-0). The SELECT-TDCS trial established that concurrent tDCS-sertraline initiation produces effects exceeding either intervention alone (10.1001/2013.jamapsychiatry.32). Esketamine achieved FDA approval specifically as a combination protocol with newly initiated oral antidepressants (10.1176/appi.ajp.2019.19020172). Meanwhile, preliminary evidence comes from sequential rTMS-ketamine protocols, where 2-year sustained remissions suggest effects beyond simple additivity (10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e02187).

These patterns suggest a unified framework in which these therapeutic modalities occupy distinct positions along axes of disruption, metaplasticity, and rewiring. Consequently, the more pressing question is how to identify the optimal combination and the order in which they are delivered. This strategy may prove more productive than simply maximizing the intensity of any single intervention.

### ECT and Psychedelic/Esketamine Combinations

The theoretical appeal of combining ECT and esketamine was considerable. Both interventions produce rapid antidepressant effects, both engage glutamatergic signaling, and trigger downstream BDNF-TrkB cascades. Ketamine's NMDA receptor antagonism of GABA interneurons was hypothesized to potentiate ECT-induced synaptic plasticity. However, the actual clinical data did not support this hypothesis.

Liu et al.'s network meta-analysis of 17 RCTs (N=1,370) established that combining ketamine with ECT does not confer additional therapeutic benefits but does increase the risk of adverse events (10.1016/j.jpsychires.2024.05.022). This conclusion is reinforced by major individual trials: the KANECT study found no difference in outcomes or cognitive side effects when using ketamine versus propofol anesthesia (10.1192/bjp.bp.116.189134), and similar negative results were reported by Anderson et al.(10.1016/S2215-0366(17)30077-9) and Carspecken et al.(10.1097/ANA.0000000000000511). Intriguingly, ketamine was the only anesthetic agent that elevated plasma BDNF levels, where other anesthetics did not, yet this biochemical signal failed to produce a clinical advantage. It is worth noting that the use of racemic ketamine as an anesthetic adjunct may not be directly comparable to the FDA-approved esketamine nasal spray.

Esketamine presents a more nuanced picture. Zeng et al.’s non-inferiority trial found comparable HAMD-17 reductions between esketamine and propofol when used as anesthetic agents; while response (80% vs. 70%) and remission (65% vs. 55%) rates were numerically higher in the esketamine group, these differences did not reach statistical significance (10.1016/j.jad.2024.09.038).

Other investigations have explored esketamine as a distinct treatment modality rather than a mere anesthetic adjunct. A case series demonstrated that pairing ECT with intranasal esketamine on non-ECT days facilitated sustained clinical improvement and allowed for extended intervals between maintenance ECT sessions in severe TRD (10.1097/YCT.0000000000001233). Another study evaluating esketamine’s efficacy in patients with a history of failed ECT found that while prior ECT exposure did not enhance treatment response, a significant proportion of these patients still achieved remission (10.1007/s00406-025-02041-9).

### ECT and rTMS Combinations

The limited efficacy of combined ECT and ketamine may be attributed to their shared mechanism of abruptly opening a metaplastic window. Since rTMS utilizes slightly different pathways, it would less likely to impede the therapeutic effects of ECT. While ECT induces structural neuroplasticity across the larger brain area, rTMS promotes circuit-level reorganization without macroscopic structural changes (10.1016/j.jad.2023.03.082). These are complementary processes operating at different scales of neural organization.

rTMS can serve as a priming intervention for ECT. For instance, a randomized, sham-controlled trial found that five sessions of left-DLPFC rTMS prior to ECT improved early clinical response (10.1017/S0033291721003810). However, the specific frequency used appears to be critical. Hansen et al. found that adding low-frequency (1 Hz) right prefrontal rTMS to ECT showed a trend toward worse outcomes, perhaps because the suppression of cortical excitability counteracts the activation effect of ECT (10.1097/YCT.0b013e3181d77645). Conversely, high-frequency rTMS may provide a synergistic or protective effect; a recent retrospective study (N=116) found that combining ECT with high-frequency rTMS preserved cognitive function while maintaining equivalent efficacy, whereas the ECT-only group showed significant cognitive decline (10.1016/j.jpsychires.2023.12.022).

According to the Disruption-Metaplasticity-Stabilization (DMS) hypothesis, initiating global disruption via ECT followed by refined neural reorganization via rTMS may offer advantages in both efficacy and safety over repetitive ECT. In clinical practice, rTMS is increasingly utilized as a less invasive maintenance strategy following an acute ECT course. Noda et al. followed six TRD patients who transitioned to sequential bilateral rTMS after responding to ECT; five maintained their response for 6–13 months (10.3389/fpsyt.2013.00073). Similarly, Cristancho et al. reported that 67% of patients transitioned from maintenance ECT to rTMS remained stable for 7–23 months, a relapse rate that compares favorably to historical data for continuation ECT alone (10.1097/YCT.0b013e31827a70ba).

While current evidence is hardly sufficient to substantiate the hypothesis that rTMS steers a system escaping a pathological attractor toward a healthy state through targeted rewiring, it remains a promising strategy to combine rTMS after ECT. Operating at a different scale of neural organization, rTMS holds the potential to prime networks prior to ECT, provide complementary neuroplastic modulation, and stabilize the reorganized state without the cumulative burden of repeated ECT.

### rTMS and SSRI Combinations

Among all combination therapies reviewed here, neuromodulation paired with serotonergic antidepressants provides the most robust evidence. Interestingly, a recent meta-analysis of 14 RCTs revealed that SSRIs significantly improve rTMS outcomes, whereas SNRIs do not (10.1016/j.eclinm.2024.102760). Both classes increase synaptic serotonin, but SNRIs also increase norepinephrine, which raises cortical excitability. While increasing norepinephrine before rTMS with stimulants has been shown to enhance its effects (10.1016/j.brs.2008.06.002; 10.1002/da.23255; 10.1002/brb3.1275), the finding that adding SNRIs after rTMS provides little benefit is counterintuitive. However, this may be explained by the hypothesis that increased cortical excitability is necessary only for the initial disruption phase, while suppression of excitability may be more beneficial during the subsequent metaplasticity-rewiring phase.

Additional meta-analytic evidence reinforces the combination's efficacy. Active rTMS concurrent with antidepressants consistently outperforms sham rTMS with the same medications (10.1016/j.jad.2024.05.037). 

The ASCERTAIN-TRD study extends these findings to treatment-resistant populations. Papakostas et al. (10.1038/s41380-024-02468-x) compared three augmentation strategies in patients who had failed at least two antidepressant trials: rTMS augmentation, aripiprazole augmentation, and medication switch. In this large multicenter trial (N=278), rTMS augmentation outperformed both aripiprazole augmentation and medication switch in terms of MADRS change and response rates.

The synergy between SSRIs and rTMS likely arises from convergent yet non-redundant neuroplastic pathways. SSRIs modulate synaptic plasticity by altering global neuromodulatory tone—a "bottom-up" process—whereas rTMS facilitates long-term potentiation (LTP) within hippocampal circuits via targeted DLPFC stimulation, representing a "top-down" enhancement of prefrontal-limbic regulation. While both modalities converge on neuroplastic mechanisms, their distinct anatomical targets and temporal dynamics may provide a complementary framework for clinical recovery.

### rTMS and Ketamine Combinations

The combination of rTMS and ketamine is theoretically compelling, though the empirical evidence is scant. Both modalities share a common molecular cascade, upregulating BDNF, activating the mTOR pathway, and potentiating AMPA-mediated glutamatergic transmission. Dębowska et al.(10.3389/fnins.2023.1267647) elucidated a potential mechanism of action underlying combined treatment. Ketamine facilitates widespread neurochemical enhancements through increased glutaminergic and dopaminergic transmission and elevated BDNF expression, while rTMS delivers specific modulation to targeted brain structures such as the dlPFC and limbic regions, thereby working together to normalize functional connectivity and restore the balance disrupted by depressive disorders. Notably, while the ECT-ketamine pairing is complicated by NMDA antagonism potentially interfering with seizure-induced plasticity, the rTMS-ketamine combination does not have such a problem.

Arubuolawe et al. (10.7759/cureus.64712) synthesized the sparse available evidence, concluding tentatively that the rTMS-ketamine combination yields superior improvements in TRD compared to monotherapy. However, Shanok et al.(10.1007/s00213-024-06573-1) compared rTMS plus IV ketamine (N=66) against TMS alone (N=169) and found no significant differences in symptom reduction or response rates. The lack of standardized protocols, such as timing, dosage, and delivery method (IV ketamine vs. intranasal esketamine), currently precludes an objective comparison.

Psilocybin with rTMS combination might be a logical extension of these strategies. An ongoing clinical trial (NCT06132178) is currently investigating this combination, leveraging the finding that psychedelics can reopen critical period plasticity (10.1038/s41586-023-06204-3). This framework maps directly onto the DMS hypothesis: psilocybin reopens the metaplasticity window, and rTMS provides the spatially targeted input required for the rewiring phase. Delivering rTMS within this window may facilitate consolidation effects that are typically difficult to achieve under the constraints of mature adult plasticity.

### Psychedelics and SSRI Combinations

Theoretically, the interaction between psychedelics and SSRIs is often viewed as antagonistic; while both increase serotonergic tone, chronic SSRI administration typically leads to 5-HT₂ₐ receptor downregulation, which could dampen the therapeutic effects of psychedelics. Consequently, a sequential approach, in which psychedelic treatment is followed by SSRI maintenance might be more advantageous than concurrent administration.

In this context, the combination of esketamine nasal spray and oral antidepressants is already approved by FDA as a treatment strategy for TRD. In a pivotal randomized controlled trial of 227 TRD patients, the addition of esketamine to a newly initiated oral antidepressant resulted in a 4.0-point greater reduction in MADRS scores compared to placebo spray (10.1176/appi.ajp.2019.19020172). The ESCAPE-TRD study (10.1056/NEJMoa2304145) further validated this approach in a larger cohort (N=676), demonstrating that simultaneously initiating esketamine with an SSRI/SNRI was significantly superior to quetiapine XR + SSRI/SNRI augmentation.

Emerging evidence regarding psilocybin likewise challenges the assumption that SSRIs necessarily block psychedelic efficacy. In an open-label study involving 19 TRD patients who maintained their stable SSRI regimens, a single 25 mg dose of psilocybin led to a mean MADRS reduction of 14.9 points at week three, with both response and remission rates reaching 42.1% (10.1056/NEJMoa2206443).
On the contrary, an intriguing finding from a post-hoc RCT analysis indicates that SSRI/SNRI discontinuation prior to psilocybin therapy was associated with reduced rather than enhanced treatment effects compared with unmedicated patients (10.1177/02698811241237870). While withdrawal-induced relapse may confound baseline severity, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions, the observation that maintaining rather than discontinuing SSRIs/SNRIs yields better outcomes suggests a potential synergistic effect between the two treatments.

### Conclusions

The evidence assembled here resists easy integration. Some combinations with strong theoretical rationale fail clinically; others succeed despite predictions of antagonism. Yet certain patterns emerge that may guide both clinical practice and future research.

The ECT-ketamine pairing, despite shared glutamatergic and BDNF pathways, often results in clinical interference rather than synergy. Conversely, the psychedelic-SSRI combination—theoretically antagonistic due to receptor downregulation—has shown surprisingly promising clinical outcomes. In the cases of ECT-SSRI and rTMS-SSRI combinations, pharmacological and non-pharmacological modalities appear to act synergistically, with medication providing a stable foundation for maintaining the remission induced by neurostimulation. For the rTMS-ketamine combination, a temporal synergy emerges where ketamine provides rapid acute relief while rTMS facilitates the subsequent consolidation and rewiring phases.

Despite the growing body of clinical evidence, the optimal timing, sequence, dosage, and duration for these combined modalities remain largely undefined. The DMS (Disruption, Metaplasticity, Stabilization) framework offers a valuable heuristic for navigating these complexities. We propose a sequential model in which "disruptive" interventions like ECT or ketamine are administered first to break pathological states, followed by "metaplastic" interventions such as psilocybin or rTMS to facilitate reorganization. Pharmacotherapy may be most effective when initiated concurrently or as a follow-up to stabilize these gains. Furthermore, given its significant rewiring potential, rTMS remains a viable augmentation strategy for patients already on stable medication regimens. However, specific pharmacological priming—such as the use of stimulants prior to rTMS—may be necessary to maximize cortical excitability and enhance therapeutic outcomes. In contrast, combinations that failed to show significant benefits appear to have plausible explanations, such as anti-seizure interference (ECT-ketamine), antagonistic effects (low-frequency rTMS during ECT), or suboptimal timing (tDCS add-on to stable SSRI) (10.1017/neu.2020.28; 10.1016/S0140-6736(23)00640-2).
