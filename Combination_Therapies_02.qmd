## Part I: ECT and SSRI/Antipsychotic Combinations

The treatment modalities discussed in this review all exert their therapeutic effects by modulating neuroplasticity. Consequently, it might be intuitively assumed that combining these interventions would yield additive effects or that outcomes would be dictated by the more potent modality. However, clinical evidence regarding these combination therapies reveals outcomes that frequently diverge from these expectations.


The most instructive finding may be a negative one. ECT and ketamine—separately among the most potent antidepressants available—produce no synergy when combined. Across multiple RCTs, ketamine anesthesia during ECT fails to improve outcomes and may actively interfere with therapeutic mechanisms (PMID: 38744161; 10.1192/bjp.bp.116.189134; 10.1016/S2215-0366(17)30077-9). This pattern challenges the assumption that "more plasticity is better" and suggests a more nuanced principle: the timing and sequence of plasticity-modulating interventions matter as much as their individual potency.

The successes reinforce this principle. rTMS combined with SSRIs—but notably not SNRIs—demonstrates robust additive effects, pointing to serotonergic priming of cortical excitability as a prerequisite for stimulation-induced plasticity (10.1016/S2589-5370(24)00339-0). The SELECT-TDCS trial established that concurrent tDCS-sertraline initiation produces effects exceeding either intervention alone (10.1001/2013.jamapsychiatry.32). Esketamine achieved FDA approval specifically as a combination protocol with newly initiated oral antidepressants (10.1176/appi.ajp.2019.19020172). Meanwhile, the most intriguing preliminary evidence comes from sequential rTMS-ketamine protocols, where 2-year sustained remissions suggest effects beyond simple additivity (10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e02187).

These patterns gesture toward a framework in which ECT, psychedelics, neuromodulation, and pharmacotherapy occupy distinct positions along axes of network disruption, metaplasticity modulation, and consolidation support. The clinical question is not merely whether to combine, but how to sequence interventions so that disruption opens a window, plasticity modulators shape its trajectory, and consolidation mechanisms stabilize the therapeutic outcome. The evidence reviewed here suggests that optimizing this temporal architecture may matter more than maximizing the intensity of any single modality.

## Part II: ECT and Psychedelic/Esketamine Combinations

The combination of ECT with ketamine represents a cautionary tale in translational neuroscience—a case where robust mechanistic rationale met consistent clinical disappointment.

The theoretical appeal was considerable. Both interventions produce rapid antidepressant effects, both engage glutamatergic signaling, and both trigger downstream BDNF-TrkB cascades. Ketamine's NMDA receptor antagonism was hypothesized to potentiate ECT-induced synaptic plasticity. Yet when this hypothesis reached the clinic, the data told a different story.

Liu et al.'s network meta-analysis of 17 RCTs (N=1,370) established the hierarchy clearly: ECT alone outperformed ketamine-ECT combination, which in turn outperformed ketamine alone (PMID: 38744161). The combination provided no additional efficacy while increasing adverse events. Individual trials reinforced this conclusion. The KANECT trial found no differences in depression outcomes or required ECT sessions between ketamine (up to 2 mg/kg) and propofol anesthesia (10.1192/bjp.bp.116.189134). Anderson et al. reported similarly negative results for ketamine augmentation versus saline (10.1016/S2215-0366(17)30077-9). Carspecken et al. observed no depression score differences between ketamine and methohexital groups—though notably, plasma BDNF elevation occurred only with ketamine (PMID: 29847468). The dissociation between BDNF elevation and clinical outcome underscores a recurring theme: neuroplasticity markers do not automatically translate to therapeutic benefit.

One mechanistic interpretation has gained traction. Ketamine's NMDA antagonism may block the very long-term potentiation that ECT requires for its therapeutic effect. If ECT works partly through controlled seizure-induced LTP, then concurrent NMDA blockade could undermine rather than enhance this process. The timing of plasticity induction, it appears, cannot be collapsed into simultaneity without consequence.

Esketamine presents a more ambiguous picture. Zeng et al.'s non-inferiority trial showed comparable HAMD-17 reduction versus propofol, though response rates (80% vs. 70%) and remission rates (65% vs. 55%) did not meet non-inferiority thresholds (PMID: 39265871). The more promising signals concern cognitive outcomes rather than mood. A 2024 mechanistic study demonstrated that both esketamine and ECT activate the PI3K/Akt/GLT-1 pathway, reducing glutamate levels, with synergistic behavioral improvement in animal models (PMID: 39265873). Whether this glutamate-lowering synergy translates to cognitive protection in humans remains an open empirical matter.

The field has increasingly turned to sequential rather than concurrent protocols—a shift that implicitly acknowledges the timing problem. A case series documented that pairing ECT with intranasal esketamine on non-ECT days enabled sustained improvement and extended maintenance ECT intervals in severe TRD (10.1097/YCT.0000000000001233). A separate cohort study reported favorable outcomes using esketamine as a bridging strategy in ECT non-responders (10.1007/s00406-025-02041-9). These sequential approaches treat ketamine/esketamine not as ECT potentiators but as distinct interventions occupying a different temporal niche—perhaps stabilizing the post-disruption trajectory rather than amplifying the disruption itself.

The ECT-ketamine literature thus offers a lesson that extends beyond this specific combination. Two interventions sharing downstream plasticity mechanisms may nonetheless interfere when administered simultaneously, if their upstream actions operate at cross-purposes. The critical design variables are not merely dose and target, but timing, sequence, and the phase of the plasticity process each intervention engages.


## Part III: ECT and rTMS/tDCS Combinations

If ECT-ketamine combinations illustrate how shared mechanisms can interfere, ECT-rTMS combinations suggest a different principle: interventions with complementary rather than overlapping plasticity profiles may achieve what mechanistic convergence cannot.

The distinction is not merely semantic. Cano et al.'s neuroimaging work clarifies the difference in kind. ECT induces structural neuroplasticity—neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, volumetric increases in hippocampus and amygdala. rTMS, by contrast, promotes circuit-level functional reorganization without macroscopic structural changes (10.1016/j.jad.2023.03.082). These are not two routes to the same destination but complementary processes operating at different scales of neural organization. The therapeutic question becomes how to coordinate them.

The most developed clinical strategy uses rTMS as a priming intervention before ECT. A multicenter randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial demonstrated that five sessions of neuronavigated left-DLPFC rTMS prior to ECT improved early clinical response compared with sham priming (10.1017/S0033291721003810). The rationale is intuitive within a disruption-metaplasticity framework: rTMS-induced excitability modulation may tune network gain, rendering subsequent ECT disruption more therapeutically directed. The primed network, in effect, falls differently when pushed.

Concurrent administration tells a more cautionary story. Hansen et al. found that adding low-frequency (1 Hz) right prefrontal rTMS to ECT showed a trend toward worse depression outcomes than ECT alone (10.1097/YCT.0b013e3181d77645). Low-frequency rTMS suppresses cortical excitability; applied concurrently with ECT, it may dampen the very activation patterns ECT seeks to reorganize. The finding reinforces a recurring lesson: timing and polarity matter. However, a 2024 retrospective study (N=116) found that high-frequency rTMS combined with ECT preserved cognitive function while maintaining antidepressant efficacy—suggesting that excitatory rather than inhibitory rTMS protocols may complement ECT's mechanism without undermining it.

The more common clinical application positions rTMS not before or during ECT, but after—as a maintenance strategy for patients who respond to ECT but cannot or prefer not to continue it. Noda et al. followed 6 TRD patients who achieved ECT response but discontinued due to cognitive side effects, anesthesia concerns, or time burden. Sequential bilateral rTMS (120% RMT; 600 pulses right low-frequency plus 3000 pulses left high-frequency) administered once to twice weekly maintained response in 5 of 6 patients for 6–13 months (10.3389/fpsyt.2013.00073). Cristancho et al. reported similar durability: among 6 maintenance ECT patients transitioned to maintenance TMS (average one session per 3.5 weeks), 67% maintained response at 7–23 months, with the two relapses occurring at 8–9 months (10.1097/YCT.0b013e31827a70ba). This 33% relapse rate compares favorably with the historical 37.1% for continuation ECT alone—and avoids the cumulative cognitive burden that limits long-term ECT feasibility.

The tDCS evidence remains nascent. The first RCT protocol for post-ECT cognitive recovery was registered in 2024 (ChiCTR2300071147), applying tDCS (2 mA, 30 minutes, five times weekly for two weeks) to left DLPFC within two days of ECT completion (10.1186/s12888-024-05567-9). The hypothesis—that tDCS may accelerate cognitive recovery by supporting prefrontal reconsolidation after ECT-induced disruption—awaits empirical test.

What emerges from this literature is a temporal division of labor. ECT provides high-amplitude network disruption with structural plasticity consequences. rTMS, operating at a different mechanistic register, can prime networks before disruption, potentially complement during if protocol parameters are carefully chosen, or maintain the reorganized state afterward without repeating the disruption. The two modalities need not compete for the same plasticity window; they may instead occupy sequential phases of a larger therapeutic arc.

## Part IV: rTMS/tDCS and SSRI/Antipsychotic Combinations

Among all combination therapies reviewed here, brain stimulation paired with serotonergic antidepressants commands the most robust evidence base—and offers the clearest window into why certain combinations succeed.

The headline finding comes from a 2024 eClinicalMedicine meta-analysis of 14 RCTs, which revealed an unexpected dissociation: SSRIs significantly improve rTMS outcomes, whereas SNRIs do not (10.1016/S2589-5370(24)00339-0). This pharmacological specificity demands explanation. Both drug classes increase synaptic serotonin, yet only SSRIs prime the cortex for stimulation-induced plasticity. The difference likely lies in norepinephrine's distinct effects on cortical excitability—or in downstream intracellular cascades that diverge despite overlapping monoaminergic targets. Whatever the mechanism, the clinical implication is concrete: SSRI co-administration should be preferred when augmenting with rTMS.

Additional meta-analytic evidence reinforces the combination's efficacy. Active TMS combined with pre-specified antidepressants consistently outperforms sham TMS with the same medications (10.1016/j.jad.2024.05.037), and individual-participant data meta-analysis has begun to characterize which antidepressant regimens moderate rTMS outcomes most favorably (10.1016/j.eclinm.2024.102728). The signal is consistent: these modalities potentiate each other through mechanisms that neither achieves alone.

The SELECT-TDCS trial provides the most granular evidence for additive effects (Brunoni et al., 2013). This 2×2 factorial RCT randomized 120 patients with moderate-to-severe nonpsychotic MDD to tDCS, sertraline, both, or neither. The combination produced an 11.5-point MADRS advantage over placebo (95% CI: 6.03–17.10, p<0.001). Response rates stratified cleanly: combination 63.3%, tDCS alone 43.3%, sertraline alone 33.3%, placebo 16.7% (10.1001/2013.jamapsychiatry.32). Critically, the interaction term was non-significant (p=0.48), confirming additivity rather than synergy in the strict statistical sense. The combination did produce more treatment-emergent hypomania episodes (5 of 7 total), a signal warranting clinical vigilance—perhaps reflecting that enhanced plasticity cuts both ways.

Yet not all tDCS-SSRI trials replicate this finding. The DepressionDC study (Burkhardt et al., 2023) found no significant benefit when adding 21 tDCS sessions over 6 weeks to stable SSRI treatment (N=160). The discrepancy illuminates a critical methodological variable: SELECT-TDCS initiated sertraline and tDCS concurrently in medication-naive patients, whereas DepressionDC added tDCS to established SSRI regimens. If SSRIs prime cortical plasticity during a particular temporal window—early in treatment, when receptor adaptations are still in flux—then adding stimulation after steady-state is reached may miss that window. The comparison suggests that *when* combination begins matters as much as *what* is combined.

The ASCERTAIN-TRD study extends these findings to treatment-resistant populations. Papakostas et al. (2024) compared three augmentation strategies in patients who had failed at least two antidepressant trials: rTMS augmentation, aripiprazole augmentation, and medication switch. In this large multicenter effectiveness trial (N=278), rTMS augmentation produced MADRS change of −17.39 points, significantly superior to medication switch (−13.22, p=0.015). Response rates followed suit: rTMS 52.2%, aripiprazole 38.1%, medication switch 35.8% (10.1038/s41380-024-02468-x). That rTMS outperformed a pharmacological augmentation strategy with established efficacy speaks to the added value of engaging plasticity through a different mechanistic channel.

The mechanistic picture that emerges involves convergent but non-redundant pathways. SSRIs increase serotonin neurotransmission and, over time, upregulate BDNF gene expression supporting neuronal survival and differentiation. TMS modulates limbic serotonin release through DLPFC stimulation, enhancing LTP in hippocampal circuits. One pathway operates bottom-up, modulating subcortical mood-regulatory circuits; the other works top-down, strengthening prefrontal control over limbic activity. The two meet at synaptic plasticity—but they arrive there by different routes, at different speeds, engaging different nodes of the depression network. This complementarity, rather than mechanistic redundancy, may explain why the combination works where others fail.


## Part V: rTMS/tDCS and Ketamine/Esketamine Combinations

This combination occupies an unusual position in the evidence landscape: theoretically compelling, clinically promising in early reports, yet lacking the randomized controlled trials that would establish it definitively. What data exist suggest something beyond additive effects—but the field remains in a preliminary phase where case reports and retrospective analyses carry weight they would not in more mature literatures.

The theoretical appeal is straightforward. Both rTMS and ketamine converge on plasticity-related molecular cascades: BDNF upregulation, mTOR pathway activation, AMPA receptor potentiation, enhanced glutamatergic transmission. Dębowska et al. articulated a complementary mechanism at the circuit level—rTMS increases DLPFC cerebral blood flow while ketamine enhances prefrontal global functional connectivity, potentially achieving synergistic normalization of cortical networks through parallel routes (10.3389/fnins.2023.1267647). Unlike the ECT-ketamine pairing, where NMDA antagonism may block seizure-induced LTP, the rTMS-ketamine combination involves no such mechanistic cross-purpose. rTMS induces plasticity through repeated subthreshold stimulation rather than ictal events; ketamine's NMDA antagonism, paradoxically promoting plasticity through homeostatic glutamate surges, need not interfere.

Arubuolawe et al.'s 2024 systematic review synthesized the available evidence—three case reports, one retrospective study, one preliminary study, and one review. The conclusion, necessarily tentative, was that TMS-ketamine combination produces substantial and sustained symptom improvement in TRD, with efficacy exceeding monotherapy and adverse effects limited to mild, transient phenomena (10.7759/cureus.64712). The evidence base is thin, but the direction is consistent.

The most striking data come from Best et al.'s retrospective study (2019), which documented outcomes for 28 patients receiving simultaneous 1 Hz rTMS (130% motor threshold, 30–40 minutes, targeting anterior cingulate cortex) with IV ketamine (0.2–4.7 mg/kg). CGI-S scores dropped from 6.1 to 1.7—a magnitude of change rarely seen in TRD populations. More remarkably, effects persisted: at 2-year follow-up, CGI-S remained at 1.4 (p<0.0001) (10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e02187). The authors noted a practical synergy as well—ketamine's analgesic properties enabled tolerance of higher TMS intensities than patients typically endure. Whether the durability reflects true biological synergy or selection effects in a retrospective sample cannot be determined without controlled replication.

Individual case reports reinforce the pattern while adding granularity. Elkrief et al. (2022) documented a 43-year-old male with bipolar I disorder and TRD who received a sequential protocol: two weeks of iTBS (600 pulses per session, three times daily, left DLPFC) combined with twice-weekly IV ketamine (0.5 mg/kg), followed by ten weeks of bilateral cTBS/iTBS (48 sessions total) with eight IM ketamine sessions. MADRS scores fell from 38 to 4. At one-year follow-up, complete remission was maintained (10.3389/fpsyt.2022.986378). A single case proves nothing about population-level efficacy, but sustained remission in bipolar TRD—a notoriously treatment-refractory condition—warrants attention.

Not all preliminary data point in the same direction. Shanok et al.'s study (2024) compared Deep TMS plus IV ketamine (N=66) against TMS alone (N=169) and found no significant difference in depression reduction: response rates of 80.3% versus 76.9% (p=0.13) (10.1007/s00213-024-06573-1). The null finding may reflect protocol differences—Deep TMS versus conventional rTMS, variable ketamine dosing—or it may indicate that the combination's benefits are more modest than early reports suggest. The field requires adequately powered RCTs to resolve this ambiguity.

Psilocybin-TMS combinations represent the next frontier, though clinical data remain absent. NCT06132178 is actively recruiting participants for a psilocybin-TMS trial. The theoretical rationale draws on Dölen et al.'s demonstration (Nature, 2023) that psychedelics reopen critical period plasticity—a transient state of heightened malleability typically restricted to early development. If psilocybin reopens such a window, TMS-induced LTP delivered within that window might achieve consolidation effects unavailable under normal adult plasticity constraints. This remains speculation until data emerge, but it illustrates the broader trajectory: toward combination protocols designed around temporal windows of enhanced plasticity rather than simple mechanistic addition.

The rTMS-ketamine literature, preliminary as it is, reinforces a theme running through this review. The combinations that show promise are those where interventions occupy complementary positions in a plasticity sequence—one inducing a state of enhanced malleability, another shaping the direction of change, a third consolidating the outcome. The failures occur when interventions compete for the same mechanistic niche or, worse, undermine each other's upstream actions. Designing combinations around this temporal architecture, rather than simply stacking plasticity-promoting interventions, may be the path forward.

## Part VI: Psychedelics and Serotonergic Antidepressant Combinations

The intersection of psychedelics and SSRIs was long considered pharmacologically forbidden territory. Classical teaching held that chronic SSRI use downregulates 5-HT₂ₐ receptors—the very binding sites through which psychedelics exert their effects. The prediction followed logically: SSRIs should attenuate or abolish psychedelic responses. Recent clinical evidence has complicated this picture substantially, revealing interactions more nuanced than simple receptor competition.

Esketamine combined with oral antidepressants stands apart from this discussion as the only FDA-approved psychedelic combination, and the regulatory pathway itself is instructive. TRANSFORM-2 (Popova et al., 2019) randomized 227 TRD patients to esketamine nasal spray (56–84 mg twice weekly) plus newly initiated oral antidepressant versus placebo spray plus oral antidepressant. The combination achieved a 4.0-point MADRS advantage at day 28 (95% CI: −7.31 to −0.64) (10.1176/appi.ajp.2019.19020172). The ESCAPE-TRD study (2024) extended this finding in a larger comparison: esketamine plus SSRI/SNRI continuation proved significantly superior to quetiapine XR plus SSRI/SNRI across 676 patients in 24 countries, with advantages in both remission and relapse rates (10.1056/NEJMoa2304145). Notably, the approved protocol mandates concurrent oral antidepressant initiation—the combination is the treatment, not an augmentation strategy.

The psilocybin-SSRI interaction presents a more surprising picture. COMPASS Pathways' phase 2 study (Goodwin et al., 2023) administered 25 mg psilocybin to 19 TRD patients maintained on stable SSRIs. MADRS change at week 3 was −14.9 points (95% CI: −20.7 to −9.2), with response and remission rates both at 42.1%. No serotonin syndrome occurred (10.1038/s41386-023-01648-7). These effect sizes, while modest by psilocybin monotherapy standards, challenge the assumption that SSRIs necessarily block psychedelic efficacy.

Mechanistic work by Becker et al. (2022) illuminates why the interaction may be less antagonistic than predicted. In a double-blind crossover study of 23 healthy volunteers, escitalopram pretreatment (10 mg for 7 days, then 20 mg for 7 days) did not meaningfully reduce psilocybin's positive mood effects. Instead, it significantly attenuated anxiety, adverse subjective effects, and cardiovascular responses—a potentially favorable modulation of the acute experience. Crucially, psilocybin-induced BDNF elevation was preserved under escitalopram pretreatment (10.1002/cpt.2487). This finding aligns with Vargas et al.'s proposal (Science, 2023) that psychedelics promote neuroplasticity through intracellular 5-HT₂ₐ receptors rather than cell-surface binding alone. SSRIs increase extracellular serotonin but may leave intracellular receptor-mediated plasticity largely intact—a dissociation invisible to classical receptor occupancy models.

A counterpoint emerges from post-hoc RCT analysis indicating that SSRI/SNRI discontinuation prior to psilocybin therapy was associated with reduced rather than enhanced treatment effects compared with unmedicated entrants (10.1177/02698811241237870). This paradox admits multiple interpretations: withdrawal-induced relapse may confound baseline severity; alternatively, chronic serotonergic exposure may induce receptor-level adaptations that paradoxically prime psychedelic sensitivity. The question remains unresolved, but the clinical implication is noteworthy—mandatory SSRI washout before psychedelic therapy may not be necessary and could potentially be counterproductive.

DMT-SSRI combinations add another dimension. Small Pharma's phase 1/2 study (2023) of IV DMT (SPL026, 27.5 mg) found that SSRI-taking participants (N=18) showed greater antidepressant effects than unmedicated participants. This unexpected enhancement—the opposite of the predicted attenuation—may reflect DMT's distinct pharmacokinetic profile. Unlike ayahuasca, isolated DMT lacks MAOI components, reducing serotonin syndrome risk and potentially enabling interactions unavailable to ayahuasca-SSRI combinations. Indeed, ayahuasca requires distinct consideration: Palhano-Fontes et al.'s RCT (2019, N=29) demonstrated significant antidepressant effects (Cohen's d=1.49 at day 7), but the harmala alkaloid MAOIs in ayahuasca render SSRI combination contraindicated for serotonin syndrome risk (10.1017/S0033291718001356).

Antipsychotic-psychedelic interactions operate on different principles—antagonism rather than modulation. Vollenweider et al. (1998) demonstrated that risperidone pretreatment (0.5–1 mg) dose-dependently blocked 69–99% of psilocybin's subjective effects, with the selective 5-HT₂ₐ antagonist ketanserin achieving complete blockade. Haloperidol, acting primarily at D₂ receptors, failed to block perceptual effects but paradoxically increased anxiety and ego dissolution distress. This dissociation definitively establishes 5-HT₂ₐ as the mediating receptor for psychedelic phenomenology—and indicates that antipsychotic co-administration, while potentially useful for managing adverse reactions, fundamentally opposes rather than complements psychedelic mechanisms.

The psychedelic-SSRI literature thus revises a long-standing assumption. The interaction is neither simple antagonism nor predictable attenuation, but a complex modulation that varies with specific compounds, dosing regimens, and perhaps individual receptor expression patterns. For esketamine, concurrent oral antidepressant use is protocol-mandated. For psilocybin and DMT, SSRI co-administration may dampen adverse effects while preserving—or even enhancing—therapeutic plasticity. For ayahuasca, the MAOI content creates a genuine pharmacological contraindication. These distinctions matter clinically, but they also gesture toward a deeper principle: psychedelics and serotonergic agents occupy adjacent but distinct positions in the plasticity landscape, and their interaction depends on precisely how those positions relate.


## Conclusions

The evidence assembled here resists easy summary. Some combinations with strong theoretical rationale fail clinically; others succeed despite predictions of antagonism. Yet certain patterns emerge that may guide both clinical practice and future research.

The ECT-ketamine literature delivers the starkest lesson. Two interventions sharing glutamatergic mechanisms and downstream BDNF cascades not only fail to synergize but may actively interfere. The most plausible explanation—that ketamine's NMDA antagonism blocks ECT-induced long-term potentiation—illustrates a principle extending beyond this specific pairing: mechanistic overlap does not guarantee therapeutic complementarity. Interventions engaging the same pathway at cross-purposes can undermine each other, regardless of their individual efficacy.

The rTMS-SSRI combination offers a contrasting model. Here, two modalities converge on synaptic plasticity through genuinely distinct routes—serotonergic modulation of cortical excitability from one direction, stimulation-induced LTP from another. The meta-analytic finding that SSRIs but not SNRIs enhance rTMS outcomes (10.1016/S2589-5370(24)00339-0) provides unexpected pharmacological specificity, suggesting that the relevant variable is not monoaminergic enhancement generally but something particular to serotonergic priming of stimulation-induced plasticity. The SELECT-TDCS trial's demonstration of additive effects with concurrent tDCS-sertraline initiation (10.1001/2013.jamapsychiatry.32), contrasted with DepressionDC's null findings when tDCS was added to established SSRI regimens, points to timing as a critical moderator. The plasticity window opened by SSRI initiation may be time-limited; stimulation arriving after that window closes may miss the opportunity for potentiation.

Preliminary rTMS-ketamine data hint at something beyond additivity. Best et al.'s 2-year sustained remissions (10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e02187) and Elkrief et al.'s maintained response in bipolar TRD (10.3389/fpsyt.2022.986378) suggest durability exceeding typical expectations for either monotherapy. The mechanistic rationale—complementary circuit-level effects without the LTP-blocking interaction that undermines ECT-ketamine combinations—awaits confirmation in adequately powered RCTs, but the early signal warrants pursuit.

The psychedelic-SSRI interaction overturns longstanding assumptions. Classical receptor competition models predicted attenuation; clinical data reveal preserved efficacy, reduced adverse effects, and in some cases enhanced response. Vargas et al.'s intracellular 5-HT₂ₐ receptor hypothesis offers a mechanistic explanation: psychedelic-induced plasticity may operate through compartments that extracellular serotonin elevation leaves largely undisturbed. The clinical implication—that mandatory SSRI washout before psychedelic therapy may be unnecessary or counterproductive—requires prospective validation but already influences emerging treatment protocols.

### Clinical Implications

These findings translate to several provisional recommendations. For ECT continuation therapy, early SSRI or SNRI initiation during the acute treatment course optimizes consolidation of therapeutic gains, with the Yildiz et al. data showing 12.5% relapse with early sertraline versus 67% with placebo (10.1097/YCT.0b013e3181c189f7). For rTMS augmentation, SSRIs should be preferred over SNRIs based on differential efficacy evidence. For esketamine, concurrent oral antidepressant initiation is not merely advisable but protocol-mandated per FDA approval (10.1176/appi.ajp.2019.19020172). For psilocybin and DMT, emerging evidence suggests SSRI continuation may be acceptable and potentially beneficial, though ayahuasca remains contraindicated with serotonergic medications due to MAOI content.

### Toward a Unifying Framework

A framework is beginning to coalesce—tentatively, and subject to revision as evidence accumulates. ECT, psychedelics, ketamine, rTMS, tDCS, and pharmacotherapy may each occupy a distinct position along axes of network disruption, metaplasticity modulation, and consolidation support.

ECT provides high-amplitude disruption with structural plasticity consequences. Psychedelics may reopen critical period plasticity, creating windows of enhanced malleability. Ketamine induces rapid but transient synaptic potentiation, potentially stabilizing post-disruption trajectories when properly timed. rTMS and tDCS modulate circuit-level excitability and functional connectivity without the structural reorganization of ECT. SSRIs prime cortical plasticity over weeks, shaping the substrate on which other interventions act.

If this framework holds, the therapeutic question shifts from "which intervention is most effective?" toward "how should interventions be sequenced to optimize disruption, plasticity modulation, and consolidation?" The failures reviewed here—ECT-ketamine, low-frequency rTMS during ECT, tDCS added to established SSRI regimens—may represent not inadequate interventions but mistimed combinations, where mechanistic interference or missed plasticity windows undermined potential synergy. The successes—rTMS priming before ECT, concurrent tDCS-SSRI initiation, sequential rTMS-ketamine protocols—suggest that temporal architecture matters as much as the individual components.

### Future Directions


The disruption–metaplasticity–rewiring heuristic, while speculative, generates testable predictions. If ECT and psychedelics occupy the disruption end of the spectrum, optimal combination protocols should pair them with metaplasticity modulators (rTMS, SSRIs) timed to shape the disruption's aftermath, followed by consolidation supports (continued pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, sleep optimization) to stabilize the new configuration. Testing this sequential logic against simultaneous administration protocols would clarify whether temporal architecture truly drives outcomes or whether the framework imposes order on phenomena that remain fundamentally stochastic.

For now, the evidence warrants cautious optimism about neuroplasticity-based combinations—tempered by the recognition that "more plasticity" is not a reliable design principle. The path forward lies not in maximizing plasticity per se, but in understanding when and how to engage different phases of the plasticity process so that disruption opens a therapeutic window, modulators shape its trajectory, and consolidation mechanisms render the change durable. Getting the sequence right may matter more than any single intervention's potency.
