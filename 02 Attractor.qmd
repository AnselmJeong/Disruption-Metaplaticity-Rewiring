## From Categorical Nosology to Dynamical Systems Theory

Current psychiatric classification systems, such as the DSM, largely rely on categorical models that treat mental disorders as distinct entities. However, this framework often fails to capture the fluid reality of clinical practice, where patients frequently present with heterogeneous symptoms, extensive comorbidity, and diagnostic shifts over time [@Joober2019]. The limitations of viewing psychiatric conditions as static "essences" have prompted a shift toward **Dynamical Systems Theory (DST)**, which conceptualizes psychopathology not as a fixed disease entity, but as a specific **dynamical state** of the brain and body [@Maj2005; @Kendler2015; @Joober2019].

In this view, the vast array of neurobiological, psychological, and social variables that define a person's mental state can be mapped onto a high-dimensional **state space**. Within this space, stable psychiatric conditions emerge as multiple **attractors**: regions toward which the system naturally gravitates and becomes trapped. The surrounding territory that pulls trajectories toward an attractor is known as its **basin of attraction**. Mental illness, then, is characterized by the system becoming confined within deep, maladaptive basins that resist the transitions to other basins required for healthy psychological flexibility [@Salvi2021; @schefferEtAl2024a; @ngr2025].

## Neural Architecture as a Potential Energy Landscape

While the concept of state space attractors provides a powerful abstraction for clinical symptoms, precise physical grounding in the brain's functional organization remains a subject of ongoing investigation. It is increasingly hypothesized that at the circuit level, the network structure—specifically the recurrent collateral connections among neurons—shapes the geometry of this state space. Within this framework, the matrix of synaptic weights ($W$) is thought to define a potential energy surface, or "landscape", where the altitudes represent levels of neural activation.

As the systems' state evolves through time according to dynamic rules, it behaves like a ball rolling across this terrain. Stable equilibrium points at the bottom of valleys represent attractors, while unstable peaks and ridges act as repellors that push the system toward neighboring basins. The "dynamic resilience" of any given state, as described by Scheffer et al.[@schefferEtAl2024a], is determined by the basin's depth and the steepness of its slopes. In a resilient healthy system, deep basins allow the brain to absorb significant stressors (perturbations) and rapidly return to a stable equilibrium.

## Noise, Stability, and the Erosion of Resilience

The stability of these neural representations is constantly tested by internal noise, arising from the irregular, Poisson-like timing of individual spikes within finite neural populations [@Surez2006]. In the healthy cortex, this stochasticity is further amplified by graded, exponential firing rate distributions. This inherent variability ensures that attractor basins remain sufficiently malleable, allowing the system to absorb perturbations while maintaining the robust resilience necessary to return to a stable equilibrium [@Webb2011; @Rolls2012].

Psychopathology often emerges when structural changes, such as the dilution of connectivity or excessive synaptic pruning, flatten and rigidify these energy landscapes. This erosion of dynamic resilience makes the healthy basins fragile; as they become shallower and more rigid, even minor life stressors can push the systems' state over a repellor—a tipping point—into a pathological basin [@schefferEtAl2024a].

## The Paradox of Persistence: Hysteresis and Network Rigidity

A hallmark of severe psychiatric disorders is hysteresis: the tendency for a system to remain trapped in a maladaptive state even after the initiating stressor has vanished. While the global healthy landscape may be degraded and shallow, pathological states often develop intense local hyper-connectivity and thus deep, rigid basins [@SvozCouche2017]. This "trapping" is rooted in multi-scale deficits that span from synaptic architecture to large-scale network dynamics.

At the synaptic level, depression is closely associated with impaired neuroplasticity and structural erosion, including decreased dendritic spine density, impaired long-term potentiation (LTP), and reduced expression of plasticity-related molecules such as BDNF [@Price2010;@Duman2012;@Kang2012;@Duman2016]. These cellular-level deficits translate into macroscopic abnormalities in large-scale functional networks, particularly within the Default Mode Network (DMN) [@Yan2019;@Tozzi2021].

In healthy individuals, dynamic functional connectivity exhibits significant flexibility, allowing the brain to transition seamlessly between a diverse repertoire of attractor states according to environmental context. In contrast, patients with depression exhibit reduced temporal variability and a restricted state repertoire. This Network Rigidity leads to excessive occupancy in sub-optimal states, most notably the depressive rumination associated with the DMN [@Kaiser2016;@Demirta2016;@DOstilio2016;@Regonia2021;@Durstewitz2021;@An2024].

These maladaptive states are often reinforced by large-scale attractors, such as mutual re-excitation loops between the OFC and the DMN, which sustain persistent ruminative cycles. In these deep basins, the system's own self-reinforcing feedback entrenches the pathological state, rendering typical daily transitions impossible and necessitating more profound clinical interventions.

## Therapeutic Recovery as Landscape Reshaping

The attractor theory suggests that recovery requires fundamentally reshaping the energy landscape. Because pathological basins can be very deep and rigid (hysteresis), small perturbations often fail to dislodge the system. Intensive treatments, such as ECT, rTMS, and psychedelics, may provide a powerful reset by providing enough energy to perturb the system, and then allowing the system to settle into a new set of attractors (see Figure \@ref(fig:health_ECT)).

For example, recent neuroimaging research has informed novel insights into the action of psychedelics through the lens of attractor dynamics. One prominent model, known as "RElaxed Beliefs Under Psychedelics (REBUS)"[@CarhartHarris2019], integrates the "Entropic Brain" hypothesis with a predictive processing framework. The REBUS model postulates that psychedelics, through their agonist action at serotonin $5\text{-HT}_{2\text{A}}$ receptors, induce a dysregulation of spontaneous activity in higher-order cortical regions. This manifests as a relaxed precision-weighting on high-level prior beliefs—effectively decreasing the "stiffness" of the top-down cognitive constraints that maintain pathological attractors.

In a control-theoretic formulation, this acute perturbation was described as a "transient flattening of the control-energy landscape" [@Madsen2021; @Singleton2022]. Mechanistically, psychedelics lower the minimum energy required to transition between recurrent brain states, operationalized as a reduction in the energetic barriers separating diverse attractors. Greater energy-barrier reduction has been associated with shorter state dwell times and more entropic state sequences, consistent with a reduction in attractor "stickiness" and enhanced exploration of the brain's state space. 

Whether through the broad physiological "reset" of ECT or the precision-weighting relaxation of psychedelics, the goal of these treatments remains consistent: to manipulate neural circuit to remodel the attractor landscape to favor flexible, healthy states [@Rao2018; @Rolls2020]. This "landscape softening" creates a critical, time-limited opportunity for adaptive reconfiguration if the post-acute window is appropriately captured by psychotherapeutic and environmental support.
