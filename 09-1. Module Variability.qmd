## Modular Organization and Module Variability

The application of graph-theoretic modularity concept to brain networks began gaining momentum around 2006-2009, spearheaded by researchers including Olaf Sporns and his collaborators [@Bullmore2009; @Sporns2016]. These investigators demonstrated that human brain networks—whether derived from structural tractography or functional connectivity measurements—exhibit robust modular organization, with modules corresponding to functionally specialized systems such as visual, auditory, somatomotor, default mode, and frontoparietal networks. This modular architecture was recognized as conferring important adaptive advantages, including functional specialization, robustness to damage, and efficient information processing.

While early connectome studies focused on static structural or functional connectivity, thus "static" modularity, the brain's functional organization is inherently dynamic, fluctuating across multiple temporal scales. Recognition of this temporal dimension catalyzed a paradigm shift toward dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) analysis [@Hutchison2013]. A landmark contribution came from Mucha et al.[@Mucha2010], who developed a generalized modularity framework for multilayer networks that could accommodate time-dependent, multiscale, and multiplex network structures.

Bassett et al.[@Bassett2011] extended this multilayer framework to observe dynamic reconfiguration of brain networks during motor learning. They introduced the concept of "flexibility or module allegiance"—defined as the frequency with which a node changes its community assignment across consecutive time windows. This approach revealed that the brain's modular architecture is not static but undergoes frequent reconfiguration during learning and task performance [@Braun2015].

Building on this foundation, the concept of "modular variability" emerged as a complementary metric for characterizing temporal dynamics. Modular variability quantifies the variance in module membership across time windows at each node. Low modular variability indicates stable module affiliation over time, whereas high modular variability reflects unstable or fluctuating community assignment. Liao et al.[@Liao2017] formalized the modular variability measure and demonstrated its utility for characterizing individual differences in time-varying modular brain architecture. Global modular variability—the mean variability averaged across all network nodes—provides a summary index of whole-brain dynamic instability [@Lei2022].

## 3. Modular Organization Abnormalities in Major Depressive Disorder

Major depressive disorder (MDD) has increasingly been conceptualized as a brain network disorder characterized by disrupted functional connectivity within and between large-scale neural systems [@Kaiser2015]. Multiple lines of evidence implicate abnormal modular organization in the pathophysiology of depression. Studies examining static network topology have reported decreased global modularity in MDD patients compared to healthy controls, indicating a less well-organized modular structure [@Ye2015; @Lan2022]. This finding suggests that the normally clear-cut functional boundaries between brain modules become blurred in depression, potentially compromising the efficiency of specialized information processing.

Beyond global measures, depression is associated with specific alterations in key functional networks. The default mode network (DMN) has received particular attention given its role in self-referential rumination. Recent large-scale consortium efforts such as the REST-meta-MDD project have provided persuasive evidence of reduced DMN functional connectivity, particularly in patients with recurrent depression [@Yan2019]. However, increased anterior-posterior DMN dissociation and hyperconnectivity of specific DMN nodes have also been reported, suggesting complex, regionally heterogeneous abnormalities [@Wong2012; @Skoog2015].

The central executive network (CEN) and salience network (SN)—critical for cognitive control, attention allocation, and emotional regulation—also show disrupted organization in MDD [@Stark2015; @Wang2022]. Meta-analyses have documented both hypoconnectivity and hyperconnectivity patterns between the DMN, CEN, and SN, potentially reflecting maladaptive allocation of cognitive resources and failures of appropriate network switching [@Kaiser2015]. The triple-network model of psychopathology posits that depression involves impaired dynamic interactions among these three core networks, leading to symptoms such as persistent rumination (DMN hyperactivity), cognitive impairment (CEN dysfunction), and aberrant salience attribution [@Menon2011].

Emerging researches have revealed that MDD is characterized not only by static connectivity alterations but also by abnormal dynamics connectivity. Converging evidence from dynamic functional connectivity analyses indicates that patients with MDD exhibit heightened connectivity variability, fewer transitions between canonical connectivity states, and \*\*prolonged or shortened dwell times in particular network configurations [@Saiote2016; @Zhi2018; @Yang2022]. These findings align with attractor-state models of depression, which propose that depressive episodes involve reduced capacity for flexible state transitions.

Li et al.[@Li2019] found that temporal dynamics of intrinsic brain activity—rather than static measures—could predict suicidal ideation severity, highlighting the clinical relevance of dynamic network features. Recently, Guo et al.[@Guo2024] reported that MDD patients with suicidal ideation (SI) exhibited lower global modularity and higher modular variability in their functional brain networks compared to healthy controls [@An2024].

Particularly relevant is that ECT increased global modularity and decreased modular variability in MDD patients, particularly within the default mode network (DMN) and somatomotor network (SMN) [@Guo2024]. This suggests a normalization of aberrant brain network dynamics by highly effective treatment modality. The author of this study interpret this observation that ECT could rewire the brain's functional architecture toward a more organized modular structure with more stable temporal dynamics. These views are consistent with prior work by Fu et al.[@Fu2022] showing that ECT normalizes "metastate dynamism"—the pattern of transitions between whole-brain connectivity states—in MDD patients, restoring healthy-like state transition dynamics.

Admittedly, the observation that ECT reduces modular variability and promotes a more stable modular architecture may appear incompatible with the metaplasticity window hypothesis proposed herein. However, it is essential to distinguish between modular variability and metastability. Modular variability reflects instability in network affiliation, wherein neural populations fail to maintain consistent module membership and instead exhibit erratic intermodular fluctuations. In contrast, metastability denotes the capacity of large-scale brain networks to sustain transiently stable configurations while retaining the ability to flexibly transition between alternative states [@Deco2017; @Fukushima2018]. Whereas modular variability denotes organizational instability, metastability captures the accessibility of alternative attractor basins—that is, a condition in which neural dynamics are not rigidly confined within a pathological attractor. From this perspective, the metaplasticity window does not entail increased variability per se, but rather a restructuring of attractor topology that enables escape from maladaptive attractor states and facilitates metastable dynamics.

For example, Yang *et al.*[@Yang2024] showed that biologically plausible plasticity rules can lead to clustered network structures whose dynamics spontaneously switch among stable states (metastability). Likewise, theoretical frameworks of metastability emphasize that learning-dependent network reshaping influences dynamic repertoire and state transitions [@Brinkman2022; @Preisig2022]
