# Combination / Staged Neuromodulation–Pharmacology Strategies in Treatment‑Resistant Depression (2016–Feb 2026)

This report curates **depression-focused** clinical studies (RCTs, cohorts, case series/reports, and recent systematic reviews) from the **last ~10 years** (≥2016) in which *two* treatment modalities were explicitly **combined** or **staged** (e.g., concurrent combination, priming, augmentation, taper‑and‑bridge). The organizing heuristic is your shared framework:

> **disruption → metaplasticity → rewiring / consolidation**

Across modalities, “disruption” can be interpreted as a rapid perturbation of pathological attractor basins (e.g., ECT seizure, psychedelic acute state shift, rapid glutamatergic modulation, network‑level stimulation), while “metaplasticity” indexes a transient state of altered learning rules (e.g., synaptic permissiveness, homeostatic gain reset, altered precision weighting), and “rewiring” refers to consolidation into more adaptive, stable-yet-flexible network configurations (often operationalized by durability of clinical response and relapse prevention).

## 1) **ECT + SSRI / antipsychotics**

In practice, **continuing or adding antidepressants during an acute ECT course** is often framed as a way to *improve short‑term response and/or reduce early relapse* by biasing post‑ictal plasticity toward adaptive affective-cognitive circuitry rather than allowing rapid return to the pre‑ECT attractor. Contemporary evidence is mostly **systematic review/meta-analysis** plus **naturalistic cohorts**, with fewer modern RCTs.

**Key evidence (2016–2026):**
- A systematic review/meta‑analysis suggests that **adjuvant antidepressants during ECT** are associated with **improved efficacy** versus ECT monotherapy (while acknowledging heterogeneity and older underlying trials). DOI: https://doi.org/10.1177/0004867420952543  
- A large naturalistic cohort specifically evaluating **concomitant antidepressants + antipsychotics during ECT** reported that combination psychopharmacology **did not prolong seizure duration** and **did not reduce ECT effectiveness**, supporting feasibility/safety of “pharmacology‑supported” ECT courses. DOI: https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2024.1341508  

**Interpretation in the disruption→metaplasticity→rewiring frame:**  
ECT supplies the high‑amplitude **network disruption** (with downstream neuromodulatory cascades), whereas serotonergic/other agents may shape the **metaplasticity window** and help consolidate (“rewire”) toward a remission attractor—especially relevant when relapse risk is high immediately post‑ECT.

## 2) **ECT + psychedelics / esketamine**

### 2A) ECT + **esketamine** (direct clinical combination)
Recent clinical work has begun to test whether ECT (high‑amplitude disruption) can be paired with intranasal esketamine (rapid glutamatergic‑plasticity induction) to improve **durability** and permit **wider ECT spacing** in maintenance frameworks.

**Key evidence (2016–2026):**
- Case series of concurrent/paired schedules (ESK on non‑ECT days; ECT tapered while ESK continued) reporting **sustained symptom improvement** and the ability to **extend ECT intervals** in severe TRD. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1097/YCT.0000000000001233  
- A cohort study in ECT non‑responders reporting outcomes with **esketamine** as part of subsequent management (augmentation/bridge logic). DOI: https://doi.org/10.1007/s00406-025-02041-9  

### 2B) ECT + **ketamine anesthesia** (a related “within‑session” augmentation)
Although not identical to intranasal esketamine treatment, **ketamine as an anesthetic/adjunct in ECT** is often discussed as a combined strategy to modulate seizure quality, neurocognitive profile, and antidepressant trajectory—i.e., pairing ECT disruption with NMDA‑related plasticity mechanisms.

**Key evidence (2016–2026):**
- Randomized trial of ketamine augmentation during ECT reporting limited antidepressant benefit compared with saline (important “negative” evidence for simple additive synergy). DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S2215-0366(17)30077-9  
- Randomized study of ketamine + propofol anesthesia in ECT for MDD assessing depressive outcomes and adverse effects. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-018-1902-6  

### 2C) ECT + **classic psychedelics** (psilocybin/others)
Direct ECT+psilocybin co‑administration is **rare** in the last decade, largely due to safety/logistics and trial exclusion criteria. The more actionable “combination” issue in depression is **whether ongoing serotonergic agents blunt psychedelic efficacy** and whether washout itself introduces confounds—i.e., a *staged* strategy problem rather than a concurrent‑combination trial.

**Key evidence (2016–2026):**
- Post‑hoc RCT analysis indicating that **discontinuation of SSRI/SNRI prior to psilocybin therapy** was associated with **reduced treatment effect** compared with unmedicated trial entrants—highlighting the importance of staging rules (washout vs continuation) in psychedelic‑assisted depression treatment. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1177/02698811241237870  

**Interpretation in the framework:**  
Esketamine/ketamine are best conceptualized as **metaplasticity amplifiers** that may stabilize a post‑disruption trajectory. The emerging question is not “additive efficacy” per se, but *how to schedule* disruption and plasticity induction so that rewiring is consolidated rather than destabilized (e.g., cognitive burden, dissociation, seizure threshold, timing).

---

## 3) **ECT + rTMS / tDCS**

The most developed evidence here uses **rTMS as a “priming” intervention** to accelerate or potentiate ECT response. Conceptually, this is a staged strategy: *pre‑conditioning* cortical excitability and network gain before the major disruption.

**Key evidence (2016–2026):**
- Multicenter randomized, double‑blind, sham‑controlled trial: **five sessions of neuronavigated left‑DLPFC rTMS** prior to ECT improved early clinical response metrics compared with sham priming. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291721003810  

**tDCS + ECT:**  
Within the last decade, depression‑focused evidence remains comparatively sparse, and much of the literature concerns feasibility/protocol design rather than definitive outcome superiority. As such, robust “improved outcomes” exemplars are currently **less abundant** than for rTMS‑primed ECT.

**Interpretation in the framework:**  
Here, rTMS functions as **metaplastic priming** (gain modulation, excitability tuning) that may render subsequent ECT **disruption** more therapeutically directed and potentially reduce time‑to‑response—an explicitly staged disruption/metaplasticity coupling.

---

## 4) **rTMS / tDCS + SSRI / antipsychotics**

Because rTMS is widely used in patients already receiving antidepressants (and often augmentation agents), many trials implicitly contain pharmacotherapy. The most informative recent syntheses focus on *whether initiating/continuing antidepressants alongside TMS improves outcomes* and how medication class moderates response.

**Key evidence (2016–2026):**
- Systematic review/meta‑analysis (MDD): **active TMS + pre‑specified antidepressants** outperformed **sham TMS + the same antidepressants**, supporting a pragmatic “concurrent combination” strategy when beginning neuromodulation. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2024.05.037  
- Individual‑participant data meta‑analysis examining how concurrent antidepressant regimens relate to rTMS outcomes in depression (moderation framework, relevant for staging). DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2024.102728  
- Broader systematic review/meta‑analysis of **non‑invasive brain stimulation (including rTMS/tDCS) combined with antidepressant medication** for depression. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1186/s13643-024-02480-w  

**Interpretation in the framework:**  
NIBS supplies repeated, dose‑accumulating perturbations that can be positioned between “gentle disruption” and “rewiring,” while antidepressants may stabilize the metaplastic rules and prevent regression to the pre‑treatment attractor—especially relevant for maintenance strategies.

---

## 5) **rTMS / tDCS + psychedelics / esketamine (mostly ketamine‑family)**

The combination of TMS with ketamine/esketamine is currently supported mainly by **case reports/series**, **retrospective cohorts**, and **systematic reviews** aggregating small studies—yet these are precisely the kinds of “staged” or “concurrent” approaches that map well onto disruption–plasticity logic.

**Key evidence (2016–2026):**
- Systematic review of **TMS + ketamine** combination strategies in TRD, concluding that available small studies generally show **substantial symptom improvement**, but emphasizing heterogeneity and need for RCTs. DOI: (Cureus article; PubMed record—see DOI in journal landing page)  
- Case report explicitly describing **TMS + IV ketamine** combination therapy producing sustained remission after limited response to either alone. DOI: https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.986378  

> Note: some combination evidence includes bipolar depression; in depression‑focused synthesis, these reports are often cited to motivate mechanism and protocol design, but generalization to unipolar TRD should be stated cautiously.

**Interpretation in the framework:**  
Ketamine/esketamine can be treated as a **metaplasticity inducer** (rapid glutamatergic synaptic permissiveness), while TMS supplies repeated, targeted network perturbations that can be tuned to drive **rewiring** of fronto‑limbic control circuits. The critical design variables are timing (simultaneous vs sequential), dose density (accelerated TMS, ketamine frequency), and consolidation supports (psychotherapy, sleep, relapse‑prevention planning).

---

## 6) **Psychedelics + SSRIs or antipsychotics**

Direct concurrent combination is under‑studied in modern depression trials because most psychedelic RCTs require **washout** of serotonergic antidepressants and exclude antipsychotics. Thus, the strongest depression‑relevant evidence in the past decade concerns *staging rules* (discontinuation vs continuation) and their impact on psychedelic response.

**Key evidence (2016–2026):**
- Exploratory analysis indicating that **prior SSRI/SNRI discontinuation** was associated with **reduced response** to psilocybin therapy compared with unmedicated entrants—raising the possibility that either (i) withdrawal/relapse dynamics confound baseline severity, (ii) chronic serotonergic exposure induces receptor‑level adaptations that alter psychedelic sensitivity, or (iii) both. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1177/02698811241237870  

**Interpretation in the framework:**  
Here, the “disruption” event is the psychedelic acute state, but the **metaplastic window** may be strongly sensitive to pre‑existing serotonergic tone and receptor adaptation. The staging question becomes: *How to taper, time, or continue medications to avoid impairing the rewiring/consolidation phase while maintaining safety?*

# Practical synthesis for your framework

Across these pairs, the most “mechanistically legible” designs in your disruption→metaplasticity→rewiring model are:

1. **Priming → disruption → consolidation** (e.g., rTMS priming before ECT; DOI: https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291721003810)  
2. **Disruption + plasticity amplifier with careful spacing/taper** (ECT + intranasal esketamine, with ECT taper while ESK continues; DOI: https://doi.org/10.1097/YCT.0000000000001233)  
3. **Concurrent combination at initiation** (TMS + antidepressant from the start; DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2024.05.037)  
4. **Staging rules for psychedelic therapies** (discontinuation effects; DOI: https://doi.org/10.1177/02698811241237870)
